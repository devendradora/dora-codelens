  - Implement tab navigation system with proper state management and active tab highlighting for two tabs
  - Set default tab to Tech Stack on webview load
  - Add responsive CSS styling for modern appearance with proper spacing, colors, and typography
  - Implement JavaScript tab switching logic with proper content loading and state persistence
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_

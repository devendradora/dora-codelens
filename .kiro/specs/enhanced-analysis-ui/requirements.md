# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The DoraCodeBirdView extension needs a comprehensive and modern UI for displaying full code analysis results. The current webview has basic panels but lacks a structured tabbed interface that can properly showcase all the rich data from the backend response including tech stack, code graph, modules, functions, framework patterns, and metadata. This feature will create a modern, tabbed interface that utilizes the complete backend response structure to provide users with an organized and comprehensive view of their codebase analysis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want a modern tabbed interface for code analysis results, so that I can easily navigate between different aspects of my codebase analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the full code analysis webview opens THEN the system SHALL display a tabbed interface with distinct sections
2. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the system SHALL maintain the current state and data of other tabs
3. WHEN a tab is selected THEN the system SHALL highlight the active tab and show relevant content
4. WHEN the webview loads THEN the system SHALL default to the most relevant tab (Overview or Code Graph)
5. IF the backend response is incomplete THEN the system SHALL disable or hide tabs with missing data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want a comprehensive tech stack overview tab, so that I can understand all technologies, languages, frameworks, and dependencies in my project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the tech stack tab THEN the system SHALL display languages with file counts and percentages
2. WHEN tech stack data is available THEN the system SHALL show frameworks with versions and usage details
3. WHEN dependencies exist THEN the system SHALL list key dependencies with version information
4. WHEN displaying tech stack THEN the system SHALL use visual indicators like charts or progress bars
5. IF tech stack data is missing THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want an interactive code graph tab, so that I can visualize the relationships and structure of my codebase modules and files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the code graph tab THEN the system SHALL render an interactive graph using the modules nodes and edges data
2. WHEN graph data is available THEN the system SHALL display modules, files, and their relationships
3. WHEN interacting with graph nodes THEN the system SHALL show detailed information in tooltips or sidebars
4. WHEN the graph is complex THEN the system SHALL provide filtering and layout options
5. IF graph data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL show available nodes and indicate missing connections

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want a detailed modules overview tab, so that I can examine individual modules, their complexity, and contained files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the modules tab THEN the system SHALL list all modules with their key metrics
2. WHEN module data includes complexity THEN the system SHALL display complexity levels with visual indicators
3. WHEN modules contain files THEN the system SHALL show expandable file lists for each module
4. WHEN sorting options are available THEN the system SHALL allow sorting by complexity, size, or name
5. IF module data is missing THEN the system SHALL show an informative empty state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want a functions analysis tab, so that I can review function-level metrics and identify potential code quality issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN functions data is available THEN the system SHALL display a functions analysis tab
2. WHEN viewing functions THEN the system SHALL show function names, complexity, and location information
3. WHEN functions have high complexity THEN the system SHALL highlight them with warning indicators
4. WHEN function details are available THEN the system SHALL provide expandable details for each function
5. IF functions data is not available THEN the system SHALL hide the functions tab

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want a framework patterns tab, so that I can understand how my code follows or deviates from established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN framework patterns data exists THEN the system SHALL display a framework patterns tab
2. WHEN viewing patterns THEN the system SHALL show detected patterns with confidence levels
3. WHEN patterns have recommendations THEN the system SHALL display actionable suggestions
4. WHEN pattern analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL show compliance scores or metrics
5. IF no patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL show guidance on pattern detection

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want a metadata and diagnostics tab, so that I can review analysis metadata, warnings, errors, and system information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis metadata exists THEN the system SHALL display a metadata tab
2. WHEN errors or warnings occur THEN the system SHALL prominently display them in the metadata tab
3. WHEN analysis is successful THEN the system SHALL show success indicators and analysis statistics
4. WHEN schema version information is available THEN the system SHALL display version compatibility details
5. IF debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide access to raw response data in this tab

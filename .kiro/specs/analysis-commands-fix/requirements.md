# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The DoraCodeBirdView extension currently has non-functional analysis commands where clicking "full code analysis" or "current code analysis" doesn't display any results to users. Additionally, the git analytics functionality needs to be consolidated into a single, clear option. This feature aims to fix these core analysis command issues and streamline the git analytics interface to provide a working, user-friendly code analysis experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the DoraCodeBirdView extension, I want the full code analysis command to display results when clicked, so that I can analyze my entire codebase effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "full code analysis" command THEN the system SHALL execute the analysis and display results in a webview
2. WHEN the full code analysis is running THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator to the user
3. WHEN the full code analysis completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display the analysis results in a properly formatted view
4. WHEN the full code analysis encounters an error THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message to the user
5. IF the analysis takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide progress feedback to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using the DoraCodeBirdView extension, I want the current file analysis command to display results when clicked, so that I can analyze the file I'm currently working on.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "current file analysis" command THEN the system SHALL execute the analysis for the active file and display results
2. WHEN no file is currently open THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message indicating no file is selected
3. WHEN the current file analysis completes THEN the system SHALL display file-specific analysis results including complexity, dependencies, and structure
4. WHEN the current file analysis fails THEN the system SHALL display a descriptive error message
5. IF the current file is not a supported file type THEN the system SHALL inform the user about supported file types

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using the DoraCodeBirdView extension, I want a single, clear git analytics option, so that I can access git-related analysis without confusion about multiple similar options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the command palette THEN the system SHALL show only one git analytics command option
2. WHEN the git analytics command is executed THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive git analysis including commit history, contributor analytics, and code churn metrics
3. WHEN git analytics is running THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about the analysis progress
4. WHEN the git repository is not available or accessible THEN the system SHALL display an informative error message
5. IF multiple git analytics options previously existed THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into a single, well-named command

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using the DoraCodeBirdView extension, I want consistent error handling across all analysis commands, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any analysis command encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log the error details for debugging purposes
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages without exposing technical implementation details
3. WHEN the Python analyzer service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest troubleshooting steps
4. WHEN workspace permissions prevent analysis THEN the system SHALL guide the user on how to resolve permission issues
5. IF an analysis command is called multiple times rapidly THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate executions and inform the user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer using the DoraCodeBirdView extension, I want visual feedback during analysis operations, so that I know the system is working and can estimate completion time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any analysis command starts THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator
2. WHEN analysis is in progress THEN the system SHALL show the current operation being performed
3. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL remove progress indicators and show results
4. WHEN analysis is cancelled by the user THEN the system SHALL stop the operation and clean up resources
5. IF analysis takes longer than 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL provide an option to cancel the operation

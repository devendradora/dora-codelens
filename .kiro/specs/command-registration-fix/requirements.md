# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The DoraCodeLens extension is failing to activate due to a duplicate command registration error. The error "command 'doracodelens.codeLensStateChanged' already exists" indicates that the same command is being registered multiple times during extension activation, preventing the extension from loading properly. This issue needs to be resolved to restore extension functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using DoraCodeLens, I want the extension to activate successfully without command registration errors, so that I can use all the extension's analysis features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is activated THEN the system SHALL NOT attempt to register duplicate commands
2. WHEN the extension loads THEN all commands SHALL be registered exactly once
3. WHEN the extension activates THEN it SHALL complete activation without throwing command registration errors
4. WHEN the extension is reloaded THEN it SHALL properly dispose of existing commands before registering new ones

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper command lifecycle management, so that commands are cleanly registered and disposed of during extension lifecycle events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is disposed THEN all registered commands SHALL be properly unregistered
2. WHEN the extension is reactivated THEN it SHALL check for existing command registrations before attempting to register new ones
3. WHEN command registration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which command caused the failure
4. WHEN multiple instances of the extension attempt to load THEN only one instance SHALL successfully register commands

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the SidebarContentProvider to manage command registration safely, so that state change listeners don't cause duplicate registrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SidebarContentProvider initializes THEN it SHALL check if commands are already registered before attempting registration
2. WHEN registerStateListeners is called multiple times THEN it SHALL NOT create duplicate command registrations
3. WHEN the sidebar provider is disposed THEN it SHALL clean up all its registered commands
4. WHEN the extension restarts THEN the sidebar provider SHALL reinitialize commands without conflicts

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical UI/UX issues in the VS Code extension's webview components, focusing on modal functionality, full-screen display, navigation controls, and restructuring submenus into tabbed interfaces for better user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want modal close buttons to work properly so that I can easily dismiss modal dialogs when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the close (x) button on any modal THEN the system SHALL close the modal and return to the previous view
2. WHEN a user presses the Escape key while a modal is open THEN the system SHALL close the modal
3. WHEN a modal is closed THEN the system SHALL properly clean up event listeners and DOM elements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer analyzing code, I want modals to occupy the full screen width and height so that I can view content without space constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a modal is opened THEN the system SHALL display it at 100% viewport width and height
2. WHEN the viewport is resized while a modal is open THEN the system SHALL maintain full-screen coverage
3. WHEN content exceeds modal dimensions THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate scrolling mechanisms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer examining code analysis results, I want search, zoom in/out, and reset view controls so that I can navigate and examine content effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing full code analysis or current code analysis THEN the system SHALL provide a search input field
2. WHEN a user enters text in the search field THEN the system SHALL highlight matching content in real-time
3. WHEN a user clicks zoom in THEN the system SHALL increase content scale by 10%
4. WHEN a user clicks zoom out THEN the system SHALL decrease content scale by 10%
5. WHEN a user clicks reset view THEN the system SHALL restore original zoom level and clear search filters
6. WHEN zoom level changes THEN the system SHALL maintain content readability and layout integrity

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with database schemas, I want the DB Schema option to show content in tabs instead of submenus so that I can quickly switch between different views.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects DB Schema THEN the system SHALL display a tabbed interface with two tabs
2. WHEN the Graph View tab is active THEN the system SHALL show an ER diagram with entity relationships
3. WHEN the Create Statements tab is active THEN the system SHALL show SQL create table statements
4. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the system SHALL preserve the current state of each tab's content
5. WHEN DB Schema content fails to render THEN the system SHALL display a meaningful error message instead of throwing JavaScript errors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer using git analysis and JSON utilities, I want these features to appear as tabs instead of submenus so that I can access different views more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects Git Commits THEN the system SHALL display a tabbed interface for different git analysis views
2. WHEN a user selects JSON Utils THEN the system SHALL display a tabbed interface for different JSON utility functions
3. WHEN switching between tabs in any feature THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions without page reloads
4. WHEN a tab is selected THEN the system SHALL update the URL or state to reflect the current view
5. WHEN returning to a previously viewed tab THEN the system SHALL restore the previous state and scroll position

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want consistent navigation patterns across all features so that I can learn the interface once and apply it everywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any feature uses multiple views THEN the system SHALL implement them as tabs rather than dropdown submenus
2. WHEN tabs are displayed THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling and behavior across all features
3. WHEN a tab is active THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual indication of the current selection
4. WHEN tabs exceed available width THEN the system SHALL provide horizontal scrolling or responsive behavior
5. WHEN keyboard navigation is used THEN the system SHALL support arrow keys and Enter for tab selection

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the webview provider architecture by consolidating functionality from the standalone `src/webview-provider.ts` into the `src/tabbed-webview-provider.ts` and ensuring the "DoraCodeBird: Show Tech Stack Graph" command displays the tech stack in a full code analysis tabbed interface rather than a separate webview.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the "DoraCodeBird: Show Tech Stack Graph" command to show the tech stack in a comprehensive tabbed analysis view, so that I can see the tech stack alongside other analysis data in a unified interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs "DoraCodeBird: Show Tech Stack Graph" command THEN the system SHALL display the tech stack in the tabbed webview provider with the tech stack tab active
2. WHEN the tech stack is displayed THEN the system SHALL show comprehensive tech stack information including frameworks, libraries, package manager, and Python version
3. WHEN the tabbed view is opened THEN the system SHALL provide tabs for Tech Stack, Code Graph, and Code Graph JSON views
4. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the system SHALL maintain the analysis data and provide smooth transitions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the webview provider code to be consolidated and modular, so that the codebase is easier to maintain and extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL have removed `src/webview-provider.ts` file
2. WHEN core webview functionality is needed THEN the system SHALL use modular functions extracted from the original webview provider
3. WHEN the tabbed webview provider needs webview functionality THEN the system SHALL use the extracted core functions
4. WHEN the system processes analysis data THEN the system SHALL use consistent data transformation functions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing functionality to continue working after the refactoring, so that no features are broken during the consolidation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any existing webview command is executed THEN the system SHALL continue to function as before
2. WHEN analysis data is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the same information quality and format
3. WHEN error handling occurs THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error messages and fallback behavior
4. WHEN the webview is disposed or recreated THEN the system SHALL handle state management correctly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tech stack visualization to be comprehensive and informative, so that I can understand the complete technology landscape of my project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tech stack data is available THEN the system SHALL display frameworks, libraries, package manager, and Python version information
2. WHEN tech stack data is missing or incomplete THEN the system SHALL show appropriate fallback messages
3. WHEN the tech stack tab is active THEN the system SHALL format the information in a readable, organized manner
4. WHEN tech stack information includes version numbers THEN the system SHALL display them alongside the technology names

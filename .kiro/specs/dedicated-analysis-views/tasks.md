# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create dedicated analysis view system with enhanced graph visualization

  - Create `DedicatedAnalysisViewManager` class to orchestrate Full Code Analysis, Current File Analysis, and Git Analytics views
  - Implement enhanced graph data models (`ModuleNode`, `FileNode`, `DependencyEdge`) with complexity calculation and color mapping
  - Create `EnhancedGraphRenderer` class that renders modules as rectangles, files as complexity-colored circles, and dependencies as arrows
  - Implement data transformation utilities to convert existing analysis data to enhanced graph format
  - Add interactive graph controls (zoom, pan, reset, node expansion/collapse, hover tooltips)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [x] 2. Implement analysis-specific controllers and features

  - Create `FullCodeAnalysisController` with full codebase visualization, complexity filtering, and module grouping
  - Implement `CurrentFileAnalysisController` with current file highlighting, dependency tracking, and automatic file change updates
  - Create `GitAnalyticsController` with commit history, contributor stats, file hotspots, and git-specific filtering
  - Add view-specific features like project structure visualization, focused dependency views, and repository timeline
  - Implement independent state management for each analysis view with proper state preservation during tab switching
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5_

- [x] 3. Refactor webview system and integrate with existing architecture
  - Refactor `TabbedWebviewProvider` to support dedicated analysis tabs with separate HTML structure and CSS styling
  - Update webview message handling to support dedicated view commands and view-specific state management
  - Modify `UIManager` and `CommandManager` to work with the new dedicated view system
  - Update analysis result handling to route data to appropriate dedicated views
  - Add performance optimizations including graph virtualization, lazy loading, and memory management for large codebases
  - Implement comprehensive error handling with fallback options and user-friendly error messages
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 1.5, 5.5, 4.4_

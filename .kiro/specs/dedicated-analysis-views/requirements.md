# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates dedicated tab views for different analysis types (full code analysis, current file analysis, git analytics) with enhanced graph visualization that shows modules as rectangles, files as complexity-colored circles, and dependency arrows between components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer analyzing code, I want each analysis type to have its own dedicated tab view so that I can focus on specific analysis without visual clutter from unrelated features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the analysis dashboard THEN the system SHALL display separate dedicated tabs for Full Code Analysis, Current File Analysis, and Git Analytics
2. WHEN a user selects Full Code Analysis tab THEN the system SHALL show only full codebase analysis content without git analytics or other unrelated data
3. WHEN a user selects Current File Analysis tab THEN the system SHALL show only current file-specific analysis without full codebase data
4. WHEN a user selects Git Analytics tab THEN the system SHALL show only git-related analytics without code analysis data
5. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the system SHALL maintain the state and view settings of each tab independently

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer examining code structure, I want the code graph to render modules as rectangles and files as circles so that I can visually distinguish between folder structures and individual files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Full Code Analysis graph THEN the system SHALL render each module (folder) as a rectangle shape
2. WHEN viewing the Full Code Analysis graph THEN the system SHALL render each file as a circle shape
3. WHEN a module contains files THEN the system SHALL position file circles within or connected to their parent module rectangle
4. WHEN modules are nested THEN the system SHALL show hierarchical relationships through visual containment or clear grouping
5. WHEN the graph is rendered THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual distinction between modules and files through shape and styling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer analyzing code complexity, I want files to be colored based on their complexity level so that I can quickly identify areas that need attention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file circle is rendered THEN the system SHALL color it based on its complexity score using a gradient scale
2. WHEN complexity is low THEN the system SHALL use green coloring for the file circle
3. WHEN complexity is medium THEN the system SHALL use yellow/orange coloring for the file circle
4. WHEN complexity is high THEN the system SHALL use red coloring for the file circle
5. WHEN hovering over a file circle THEN the system SHALL display a tooltip showing the exact complexity score and metrics
6. WHEN the complexity data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use a neutral gray color and indicate missing data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer understanding code dependencies, I want to see arrows between files and modules showing their relationships so that I can trace how components interact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files have dependencies THEN the system SHALL draw arrows from dependent files to their dependencies
2. WHEN a file imports from another file THEN the system SHALL show a directed arrow indicating the import relationship
3. WHEN modules use other modules THEN the system SHALL show arrows between module rectangles indicating cross-module dependencies
4. WHEN arrows would create visual clutter THEN the system SHALL provide options to filter or group dependency arrows
5. WHEN hovering over an arrow THEN the system SHALL highlight the connection and show dependency details in a tooltip

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working with large codebases, I want interactive graph controls so that I can navigate and explore the code structure effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the code graph THEN the system SHALL provide zoom in/out controls for detailed examination
2. WHEN viewing the code graph THEN the system SHALL provide pan controls to navigate large graphs
3. WHEN clicking on a module rectangle THEN the system SHALL allow expanding/collapsing to show/hide contained files
4. WHEN clicking on a file circle THEN the system SHALL provide options to view file details or open the file in the editor
5. WHEN the graph becomes complex THEN the system SHALL provide filtering options to show/hide specific types of dependencies or complexity levels

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer analyzing current file context, I want the Current File Analysis tab to show focused dependency information so that I can understand how the current file relates to the rest of the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing Current File Analysis THEN the system SHALL highlight the current file prominently in the graph
2. WHEN viewing Current File Analysis THEN the system SHALL show direct dependencies (imports) of the current file
3. WHEN viewing Current File Analysis THEN the system SHALL show reverse dependencies (files that import the current file)
4. WHEN viewing Current File Analysis THEN the system SHALL dim or hide unrelated files to focus attention on relevant connections
5. WHEN the current file changes THEN the system SHALL automatically update the Current File Analysis view to reflect the new context

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer using git analytics, I want the Git Analytics tab to be completely separate from code analysis so that I can focus on repository history and contributor information without code structure distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing Git Analytics tab THEN the system SHALL show only git-related visualizations and data
2. WHEN viewing Git Analytics tab THEN the system SHALL NOT display code dependency graphs or complexity information
3. WHEN viewing Git Analytics tab THEN the system SHALL provide commit history, contributor statistics, and repository timeline views
4. WHEN viewing Git Analytics tab THEN the system SHALL maintain its own set of controls and filters independent of code analysis tabs
5. WHEN switching from Git Analytics to code analysis tabs THEN the system SHALL not carry over git-specific filters or view settings

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature fixes critical issues in the JSON utilities service where Python dictionary syntax conversion to JSON fails, causing errors when trying to format, minify, or validate JSON-like content that contains Python-specific syntax like single quotes, True/False/None values, and trailing commas.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the JSON utilities to properly convert Python dictionary syntax to valid JSON, so that I can work with Python-like JSON content without manual conversion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use JSON utilities on content with single quotes THEN the system SHALL convert single quotes to double quotes while preserving string content
2. WHEN I use JSON utilities on content with Python boolean values (True/False) THEN the system SHALL convert them to JSON boolean values (true/false)
3. WHEN I use JSON utilities on content with Python None values THEN the system SHALL convert them to JSON null values
4. WHEN I use JSON utilities on content with trailing commas THEN the system SHALL remove trailing commas before processing
5. WHEN the conversion process encounters nested quotes THEN the system SHALL properly escape inner quotes to maintain string integrity

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error messages when JSON conversion fails, so that I can understand what needs to be fixed in my content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JSON conversion fails due to syntax errors THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages indicating the type of error and location
2. WHEN JSON conversion fails due to unsupported Python syntax THEN the system SHALL suggest specific fixes for the problematic syntax
3. WHEN JSON conversion partially succeeds but has warnings THEN the system SHALL display warnings with suggestions for improvement
4. WHEN JSON conversion encounters unrecoverable errors THEN the system SHALL preserve the original content and show detailed error information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the JSON utilities to handle complex Python dictionary structures with nested objects and arrays, so that I can convert complex data structures reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I convert nested Python dictionaries THEN the system SHALL properly handle multiple levels of nesting
2. WHEN I convert Python dictionaries containing lists THEN the system SHALL preserve array structure and convert array elements
3. WHEN I convert Python dictionaries with mixed data types THEN the system SHALL handle strings, numbers, booleans, null values, objects, and arrays correctly
4. WHEN I convert Python dictionaries with special characters in strings THEN the system SHALL properly escape special characters

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the JSON utilities to work consistently across all operations (format, minify, validate, fix), so that I have a reliable toolset for JSON manipulation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the format command on Python dict syntax THEN the system SHALL convert to JSON and format with proper indentation
2. WHEN I use the minify command on Python dict syntax THEN the system SHALL convert to JSON and remove all unnecessary whitespace
3. WHEN I use the validate command on Python dict syntax THEN the system SHALL convert to JSON and report validation results
4. WHEN I use the fix command on Python dict syntax THEN the system SHALL convert to valid JSON format
5. WHEN any JSON utility operation fails THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent error handling and user feedback patterns

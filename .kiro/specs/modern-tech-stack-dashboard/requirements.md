# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will modernize the tech stack analysis UI in the full code analysis webview by replacing the current categorized layout with a clean, professional dashboard design. The new UI will feature a project overview section and color-coded category cards with improved visual hierarchy, better spacing, and a more intuitive layout that matches modern web application standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Project Overview Dashboard Section

**User Story:** As a developer viewing my tech stack analysis, I want to see a project overview section at the top, so that I can quickly understand key project information before diving into the technical details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tech stack analysis loads THEN the system SHALL display a project overview card at the top
2. WHEN displaying the project overview THEN the system SHALL show project name, version, status, and maintainer information
3. WHEN project information is available THEN the system SHALL extract it from package.json, pyproject.toml, or similar files
4. WHEN project information is not available THEN the system SHALL show placeholder values or "Not specified"
5. WHEN displaying the overview THEN the system SHALL use a grid layout with equal-sized information boxes

### Requirement 2: Modern Card-Based Category Layout

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each technology category displayed as a distinct card with clear visual separation, so that I can easily distinguish between different types of technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying categories THEN each SHALL be rendered as a separate card with rounded corners and subtle shadows
2. WHEN displaying category cards THEN they SHALL have consistent spacing and padding throughout
3. WHEN showing categories THEN each card SHALL have a clean white/dark background based on VS Code theme
4. WHEN displaying multiple categories THEN they SHALL be stacked vertically with appropriate margins
5. WHEN rendering cards THEN they SHALL have a maximum width for better readability on large screens

### Requirement 3: Color-Coded Category Headers

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each category to have a distinct color-coded left border, so that I can quickly identify different technology types at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying Backend category THEN it SHALL have an orange left border (#ff9800)
2. WHEN displaying Frontend category THEN it SHALL have a green left border (#4caf50)
3. WHEN displaying Databases category THEN it SHALL have a blue left border (#2196f3)
4. WHEN displaying DevOps category THEN it SHALL have a pink left border (#e91e63)
5. WHEN displaying Others category THEN it SHALL have a gray left border (#9e9e9e)

### Requirement 4: Improved Subcategory Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want subcategories within each category clearly organized with proper headings, so that I can quickly find specific types of technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying subcategories THEN each SHALL have a clear heading with appropriate typography
2. WHEN a subcategory has technologies THEN they SHALL be displayed as badge-style items
3. WHEN a subcategory is empty THEN it SHALL show "No data" in muted text
4. WHEN displaying technology badges THEN they SHALL have consistent styling and spacing
5. WHEN showing subcategories THEN they SHALL follow the order: Languages, Package Managers, Frameworks, Libraries

### Requirement 5: Clean Typography and Spacing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tech stack dashboard to have clean, readable typography and consistent spacing, so that the information is easy to scan and understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying text THEN the system SHALL use consistent font families and sizes throughout
2. WHEN showing headings THEN they SHALL have appropriate font weights and margins
3. WHEN displaying content THEN it SHALL have consistent padding and margins between elements
4. WHEN rendering the dashboard THEN it SHALL use a clean background color that matches VS Code theme
5. WHEN showing technology items THEN they SHALL have subtle hover effects for better interactivity

### Requirement 6: Responsive Design Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer using different screen sizes, I want the dashboard to adapt gracefully to my viewport, so that I can view tech stack information on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the layout SHALL use the full available width with appropriate constraints
2. WHEN viewing on tablet THEN the project overview grid SHALL adapt to smaller screens
3. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN the layout SHALL stack elements vertically for better readability
4. WHEN resizing the window THEN all elements SHALL maintain proper proportions and spacing
5. WHEN displaying on small screens THEN text SHALL remain readable without horizontal scrolling

### Requirement 7: Remove Legacy UI Elements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the old tech stack categorization UI completely replaced, so that I have a consistent modern experience without confusing legacy elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new dashboard loads THEN it SHALL completely replace the existing tech stack categorization UI
2. WHEN displaying technologies THEN the system SHALL NOT show the old category sections with subcategory headers
3. WHEN rendering the tech stack THEN it SHALL NOT use the legacy CSS classes and styling
4. WHEN showing the analysis THEN it SHALL maintain all existing functionality while using the new design
5. WHEN updating the UI THEN it SHALL preserve all data processing and categorization logic

### Requirement 8: Maintain Data Integration and Performance

**User Story:** As a system processing tech stack data, I want the new UI to integrate seamlessly with existing data processing, so that users get the same accurate information with better presentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing tech stack data THEN the system SHALL use the existing CategoryDisplayManager and related services
2. WHEN rendering categories THEN the system SHALL maintain all current deduplication and classification logic
3. WHEN displaying technologies THEN the system SHALL show the same accurate data as the current implementation
4. WHEN loading the dashboard THEN it SHALL perform at least as well as the current implementation
5. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade and show appropriate error states

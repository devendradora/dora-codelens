# Requirements Document

## Introduction

DoraCodeBirdView is an advanced VS Code extension that provides comprehensive code analysis and visualization capabilities for Python projects. Building on the foundation of CodeMindMap, DoraCodeBirdView offers enhanced features including Git analytics, improved graph visualizations with folder-based module cards, JSON utilities, and detailed author contribution tracking. The extension aims to provide developers with deep insights into their codebase structure, complexity, dependencies, and development patterns through intuitive visual interfaces and comprehensive analysis tools.

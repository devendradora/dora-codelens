# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing code lens functionality in DoraCodeLens to provide a more professional and developer-friendly experience. The enhancement focuses on improving command naming clarity, displaying function complexity metrics directly above functions, and providing actionable suggestions to help developers write better code. This will transform the code lens from a simple toggle feature into a comprehensive inline development assistant.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Python developer, I want clear and intuitive code lens command names, so that I can easily understand what each command does without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses code lens commands THEN the system SHALL display "Enable Code Lens" instead of "Toggle Code Lens" when code lens is currently disabled
2. WHEN the user accesses code lens commands THEN the system SHALL display "Disable Code Lens" instead of "Toggle Code Lens" when code lens is currently enabled
3. WHEN the user hovers over code lens commands THEN the system SHALL show descriptive tooltips explaining the functionality
4. WHEN code lens state changes THEN the system SHALL update command labels immediately to reflect the current state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer reviewing code, I want to see function complexity metrics displayed above each function, so that I can quickly identify potentially problematic code without running separate analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code lens is enabled THEN the system SHALL display cyclomatic complexity above each function definition
2. WHEN complexity is low (1-5) THEN the system SHALL display it in green color with "Low Complexity" indicator
3. WHEN complexity is moderate (6-10) THEN the system SHALL display it in yellow color with "Moderate Complexity" indicator
4. WHEN complexity is high (11+) THEN the system SHALL display it in red color with "High Complexity" indicator
5. WHEN the user clicks on complexity indicator THEN the system SHALL show detailed complexity breakdown and suggestions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer writing code, I want to receive actionable suggestions above functions, so that I can improve code quality and follow best practices in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a function has high complexity THEN the system SHALL suggest "Consider breaking this function into smaller parts"
2. WHEN a function has no docstring THEN the system SHALL suggest "Add documentation for better maintainability"
3. WHEN a function has many parameters (5+) THEN the system SHALL suggest "Consider using a configuration object or dataclass"
4. WHEN a function is very long (50+ lines) THEN the system SHALL suggest "Consider splitting this function for better readability"
5. WHEN the user clicks on a suggestion THEN the system SHALL provide detailed guidance or quick fixes where possible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want code lens to provide consistent and professional-looking inline feedback, so that it integrates seamlessly with our development workflow and doesn't distract from coding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code lens is displayed THEN the system SHALL use consistent formatting and styling across all indicators
2. WHEN multiple indicators are shown for one function THEN the system SHALL organize them in a logical hierarchy (complexity first, then suggestions)
3. WHEN code lens information is displayed THEN the system SHALL use professional language and avoid technical jargon in user-facing messages
4. WHEN the workspace has many files THEN the system SHALL ensure code lens performance doesn't impact editor responsiveness
5. WHEN code lens is disabled THEN the system SHALL remove all indicators cleanly without leaving artifacts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working on legacy code, I want code lens to help me understand and improve existing functions, so that I can refactor effectively and maintain code quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing existing functions THEN the system SHALL provide context-aware suggestions based on function content and structure
2. WHEN a function uses deprecated patterns THEN the system SHALL suggest modern alternatives where applicable
3. WHEN a function has potential performance issues THEN the system SHALL highlight optimization opportunities
4. WHEN code lens detects code smells THEN the system SHALL provide specific, actionable remediation steps
5. WHEN the user requests detailed analysis THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing DoraCodeLens analysis features

# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Implement professional code lens with dynamic commands and color-coded complexity

  - Create dynamic command registration with state-aware titles ("Enable Code Lens" vs "Disable Code Lens")
  - Add descriptive tooltips and contextual command management
  - Implement color-coded complexity display (green/yellow/red) with professional visual formatting
  - Create complexity threshold configuration and integrate with existing complexity analyzer
  - Ensure clean indicator removal and consistent styling across VS Code themes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5_

- [x] 2. Create intelligent suggestion engine with comprehensive rules and display

  - Implement core suggestion rule interface with evaluation system for complexity, documentation, parameters, and function length
  - Add suggestion prioritization, filtering, and multi-line display integration with code lens
  - Create clickable suggestion interactions with detailed guidance and quick fixes
  - Implement docstring detection, code pattern analysis, and modern Python alternative suggestions
  - Add performance optimization with caching and throttling for large files
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 4.4_

- [x] 3. Integrate with analysis pipeline and add comprehensive testing
  - Update analysis data flow to connect suggestion engine with existing complexity analyzer
  - Ensure compatibility with current DoraCodeLens features and detailed analysis integration
  - Implement graceful error handling, recovery mechanisms, and comprehensive logging
  - Create complete test suite with unit, integration, performance, and end-to-end tests
  - _Requirements: 5.5, 4.4, All requirements validation_

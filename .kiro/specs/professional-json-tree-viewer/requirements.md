# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the JSON tree view functionality to match the professional appearance and behavior of popular online JSON tree viewers like codebeautify.com. The current implementation needs to be upgraded to provide a more intuitive, visually appealing, and feature-rich JSON exploration experience that developers expect from modern JSON viewers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a professional-looking JSON tree view with proper indentation and visual hierarchy, so that I can easily navigate complex JSON structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying JSON data THEN the system SHALL render a hierarchical tree structure with proper indentation levels
2. WHEN showing nested objects or arrays THEN the system SHALL use consistent visual indicators (lines, brackets, braces) to show structure
3. WHEN displaying different data types THEN the system SHALL use distinct visual styling for strings, numbers, booleans, null values, objects, and arrays
4. WHEN rendering the tree THEN the system SHALL use a clean, professional color scheme similar to popular JSON viewers

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want expandable/collapsible nodes with intuitive controls, so that I can focus on specific parts of large JSON structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a JSON object or array has children THEN the system SHALL display a clickable expand/collapse icon (+ or -)
2. WHEN clicking an expand/collapse icon THEN the system SHALL smoothly show or hide the nested content
3. WHEN a node is collapsed THEN the system SHALL show a summary indicator (e.g., "{...}" for objects, "[...]" for arrays)
4. WHEN expanding a node THEN the system SHALL maintain the current scroll position and focus
5. WHEN loading the tree view THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of default expansion levels

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see key-value pairs clearly formatted with proper syntax highlighting, so that I can quickly identify and understand the JSON structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying object properties THEN the system SHALL show keys in quotes with distinct styling
2. WHEN showing string values THEN the system SHALL display them in quotes with string-specific coloring
3. WHEN displaying numbers THEN the system SHALL show them without quotes in number-specific coloring
4. WHEN showing boolean values THEN the system SHALL display true/false in boolean-specific coloring
5. WHEN displaying null values THEN the system SHALL show "null" in null-specific coloring
6. WHEN showing arrays THEN the system SHALL display square brackets and comma-separated values
7. WHEN displaying objects THEN the system SHALL show curly braces and properly formatted key-value pairs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want line numbers and path indicators, so that I can easily reference specific locations in the JSON structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying the tree view THEN the system SHALL show line numbers for each row
2. WHEN hovering over a node THEN the system SHALL display the JSON path to that element
3. WHEN clicking on a node THEN the system SHALL allow copying the JSON path to clipboard
4. WHEN navigating the tree THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent line numbering

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want search and filtering capabilities, so that I can quickly find specific keys or values in large JSON files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the search function THEN the system SHALL highlight matching keys and values
2. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL automatically expand nodes containing matches
3. WHEN filtering is active THEN the system SHALL show only matching nodes and their parent hierarchy
4. WHEN clearing search/filter THEN the system SHALL restore the original tree state
5. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL support case-sensitive and case-insensitive options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standard JSON viewer controls and options, so that I can customize the view according to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the viewer THEN the system SHALL provide "Expand All" and "Collapse All" buttons
2. WHEN viewing the JSON THEN the system SHALL offer options to show/hide line numbers
3. WHEN displaying the tree THEN the system SHALL allow toggling between tree view and raw JSON view
4. WHEN working with the viewer THEN the system SHALL provide a "Copy" button for the entire JSON
5. WHEN using the interface THEN the system SHALL maintain user preferences across sessions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and validation feedback, so that I can understand issues with malformed JSON data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JSON is invalid THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with line and column information
2. WHEN parsing fails THEN the system SHALL highlight the problematic area in the raw JSON
3. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide suggestions for fixing common issues
4. WHEN displaying errors THEN the system SHALL maintain the ability to view the raw text
5. WHEN JSON is valid THEN the system SHALL show a validation success indicator

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want responsive design and proper scrolling behavior, so that I can work with JSON files of any size efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing large JSON files THEN the system SHALL implement virtual scrolling for performance
2. WHEN the content exceeds the viewport THEN the system SHALL provide smooth scrolling with scroll bars
3. WHEN resizing the panel THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout responsively
4. WHEN navigating the tree THEN the system SHALL maintain proper focus and keyboard navigation
5. WHEN working with deep nesting THEN the system SHALL handle horizontal scrolling gracefully

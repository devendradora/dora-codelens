# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix Interactive Enhanced Code Graph by integrating working reference implementation
  - Extract the proven Cytoscape implementation from `analyzer/dora.html` including data processing, graph initialization, styling, and interactive features
  - Adapt the reference code to work with the analyzer's `code_graph_json` format by creating transformation functions that convert the hierarchical data structure
  - Replace the current failing graph implementation in `FullCodeAnalysisWebview` with the working reference approach, including expand/collapse functionality and proper error handling
  - Update the webview HTML and JavaScript to use the reference's Cytoscape configuration, node styling, and layout logic while adapting to VS Code themes
  - Add comprehensive error handling, loading indicators, and fallback states to prevent the "Loading module graph..." stuck state
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

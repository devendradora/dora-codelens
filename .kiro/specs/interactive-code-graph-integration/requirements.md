# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Interactive Enhanced Code Graph is currently stuck on "Loading module graph..." and not displaying the visualization. The reference implementation in `analyzer/dora.html` shows a working interactive graph with proper data handling and visualization. This feature will integrate the working reference code into the frontend to fix the loading issue and provide a functional interactive code graph.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Interactive Enhanced Code Graph to load and display properly, so that I can visualize my code structure and relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the code graph tab is opened THEN it SHALL display the interactive graph instead of being stuck on "Loading module graph..."
2. WHEN the analyzer returns code_graph_json data THEN the frontend SHALL process and display it correctly
3. WHEN the graph loads THEN it SHALL show nodes for folders, files, classes, and functions with proper styling
4. WHEN the graph is displayed THEN it SHALL be interactive with click, zoom, and pan functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the code graph to use the proven reference implementation, so that I have a reliable and functional visualization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating the reference code THEN it SHALL use the working Cytoscape implementation from dora.html
2. WHEN processing data THEN it SHALL handle the hierarchical structure correctly as shown in the reference
3. WHEN displaying nodes THEN it SHALL use the same styling and layout approach as the reference
4. WHEN handling interactions THEN it SHALL implement the same expand/collapse functionality as the reference

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the graph to handle the actual analyzer data format, so that it displays real project analysis results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analyzer provides code_graph_json THEN the graph SHALL transform it to the expected format
2. WHEN data transformation occurs THEN it SHALL preserve all node types (folder, file, class, function)
3. WHEN complexity data is available THEN it SHALL be displayed with appropriate color coding
4. WHEN call relationships exist THEN they SHALL be shown as edges between nodes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the graph to be responsive and performant, so that it works well with projects of various sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN large projects are analyzed THEN the graph SHALL load without freezing or crashing
2. WHEN nodes are expanded/collapsed THEN the layout SHALL update smoothly
3. WHEN searching or filtering THEN the graph SHALL respond quickly
4. WHEN the graph is resized THEN it SHALL adapt to the container dimensions properly

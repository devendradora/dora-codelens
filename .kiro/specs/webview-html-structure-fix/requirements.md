# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The full code analysis webview is currently stuck on "Initializing interactive code graph..." because the HTML structure is corrupted and missing essential elements. The JavaScript code references DOM elements that don't exist in the generated HTML, causing the graph initialization to fail silently.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the code graph to display properly so that I can visualize my codebase structure interactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the webview is opened THEN the HTML SHALL contain a properly structured code graph section
2. WHEN the JavaScript initializes THEN it SHALL find the required DOM elements (`enhanced-graph`, `graph-loading`)
3. WHEN the graph loads successfully THEN the loading indicator SHALL be hidden and the graph SHALL be displayed
4. WHEN the graph fails to load THEN a fallback view SHALL be shown with clear error messaging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear feedback about the graph loading state so that I know what's happening.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the webview first loads THEN a loading indicator SHALL be displayed
2. WHEN Cytoscape libraries are loading THEN the loading state SHALL persist
3. WHEN the graph initializes successfully THEN the loading indicator SHALL be hidden
4. WHEN the graph fails to initialize THEN an error state SHALL be shown with retry options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the webview code to be clean and maintainable so that future modifications are easier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the webview code THEN there SHALL be no duplicate JavaScript sections
2. WHEN the HTML is generated THEN it SHALL have a clear, logical structure
3. WHEN the JavaScript runs THEN it SHALL have proper error handling and logging
4. WHEN the code graph section is rendered THEN it SHALL contain all necessary HTML elements

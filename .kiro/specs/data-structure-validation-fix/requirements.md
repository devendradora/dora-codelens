# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The DoraCodeBirdView extension is experiencing runtime errors due to data structure mismatches between the Python analyzer output and the TypeScript webview expectations. Specifically, the full code analysis webview expects `analysisData.modules` to be an array but receives a different data structure, causing "forEach is not a function" errors. This feature addresses the need for robust data validation and transformation to ensure compatibility between the Python analyzer and TypeScript webviews.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want the webviews to handle different data structures gracefully, so that I don't encounter runtime errors when analysis data formats change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the webview receives analysis data THEN it SHALL validate the data structure before processing
2. WHEN the expected data structure is not present THEN the system SHALL attempt to transform or normalize the data
3. WHEN data transformation fails THEN the system SHALL display a meaningful error message instead of crashing
4. WHEN analysis data is missing required fields THEN the system SHALL provide default values or skip processing gracefully
5. IF the data structure is completely incompatible THEN the system SHALL log the actual structure for debugging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want consistent data structures between the Python analyzer and TypeScript webviews, so that the analysis results display correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Python analyzer outputs analysis data THEN it SHALL conform to a documented schema
2. WHEN the TypeScript webviews receive data THEN they SHALL validate against the expected schema
3. WHEN schema validation fails THEN the system SHALL log the discrepancy with actual vs expected structure
4. WHEN data structure changes are made THEN both Python and TypeScript components SHALL be updated consistently
5. IF backward compatibility is needed THEN the system SHALL support multiple data format versions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want detailed error information when data structure issues occur, so that I can diagnose and fix the problems quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data structure validation fails THEN the system SHALL log the actual data structure received
2. WHEN forEach or similar array method errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the type and content of the problematic data
3. WHEN webview rendering fails due to data issues THEN the system SHALL display the specific field that caused the problem
4. WHEN analysis data is malformed THEN the system SHALL provide suggestions for fixing the data format
5. IF debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL output detailed data transformation steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want the system to recover from data structure mismatches automatically when possible, so that I can continue working without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules data is not an array THEN the system SHALL attempt to convert it to an array format
2. WHEN required nested properties are missing THEN the system SHALL create default structures
3. WHEN data types don't match expectations THEN the system SHALL attempt type coercion where safe
4. WHEN automatic recovery succeeds THEN the system SHALL log the transformation applied
5. IF automatic recovery fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to a safe default view

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want comprehensive testing of data structure handling, so that future changes don't break the analysis display functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are run THEN they SHALL cover various data structure scenarios including malformed data
2. WHEN integration tests are executed THEN they SHALL verify end-to-end data flow from Python to TypeScript
3. WHEN new data structures are added THEN corresponding validation tests SHALL be created
4. WHEN data transformation logic is modified THEN regression tests SHALL verify existing functionality
5. IF edge cases are discovered THEN they SHALL be added to the test suite to prevent future regressions

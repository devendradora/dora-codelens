# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues with the DoraCodeBirdView extension where the context menu is not appearing on right-click and the sidebar icon is not visible in VS Code. These are essential UI components that provide users access to the extension's core functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Context Menu Visibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the DoraCodeBirdView context menu to appear when I right-click on any file (not just Python files), so that I can access the extension's features regardless of the current file type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user right-clicks on any file in the editor THEN the system SHALL display the "DoraCodeBirdView" submenu
2. WHEN a user right-clicks on a Python file THEN the system SHALL display all DoraCodeBirdView options including Full Code Analysis, Current File Analysis, Call Hierarchy, Git Analytics, JSON Utils, and DB Schema
3. WHEN a user right-clicks on a non-Python file THEN the system SHALL display universal options like Git Analytics and JSON Utils
4. WHEN the DoraCodeBirdView submenu is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the proper DoraCodeBirdView icon next to the menu label
5. WHEN no workspace is open THEN the system SHALL still show basic options like JSON Utils

### Requirement 2: Sidebar Icon Visibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see the DoraCodeBirdView icon in the VS Code activity bar sidebar, so that I can easily access the extension's tree view and analysis results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is installed and activated THEN the system SHALL display the DoraCodeBirdView icon in the VS Code activity bar
2. WHEN a Python project is detected in the workspace THEN the system SHALL show the DoraCodeBirdView icon prominently
3. WHEN the DoraCodeBirdView icon is clicked THEN the system SHALL open the Project Analysis tree view
4. WHEN no Python files are present THEN the system SHALL still show the icon but with appropriate messaging in the tree view
5. WHEN the extension is disabled THEN the system SHALL hide the DoraCodeBirdView icon from the activity bar

### Requirement 3: Menu Command Registration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all DoraCodeBirdView commands to be properly registered and accessible, so that the extension functions correctly when I use context menus or command palette.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension activates THEN the system SHALL register all DoraCodeBirdView commands successfully
2. WHEN a command is executed from the context menu THEN the system SHALL execute the corresponding functionality without errors
3. WHEN commands are accessed via the command palette THEN the system SHALL show all available DoraCodeBirdView commands with proper categorization
4. WHEN a command fails to execute THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to the user
5. WHEN the extension is reloaded THEN the system SHALL maintain all command registrations

### Requirement 4: Extension Activation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the DoraCodeBirdView extension to activate properly in different workspace scenarios, so that I can use its features consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workspace contains Python files THEN the system SHALL activate the extension automatically
2. WHEN a workspace contains requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, or Pipfile THEN the system SHALL activate the extension
3. WHEN no Python-related files are present THEN the system SHALL still allow manual activation for JSON utilities
4. WHEN multiple workspace folders are open THEN the system SHALL handle activation correctly for each folder
5. WHEN the workspace changes THEN the system SHALL re-evaluate activation conditions

### Requirement 5: Icon and Branding Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent DoraCodeBirdView branding and iconography throughout the VS Code interface, so that I can easily identify extension features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DoraCodeBirdView elements are displayed THEN the system SHALL use consistent iconography (type-hierarchy icon)
2. WHEN menus and submenus are shown THEN the system SHALL display the DoraCodeBirdView name and icon consistently
3. WHEN the extension appears in different VS Code contexts THEN the system SHALL maintain visual consistency
4. WHEN icons are displayed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate VS Code icon standards and sizing
5. WHEN themes change (light/dark) THEN the system SHALL adapt icons appropriately

### Requirement 6: Python-Specific Feature Messaging

**User Story:** As a developer working with non-Python files, I want clear messaging when Python-specific features are not available, so that I understand which features require Python support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Full Code Analysis is selected on a non-Python project THEN the system SHALL display "Currently supports only Python projects" message
2. WHEN Current File Analysis is selected on a non-Python file THEN the system SHALL display "Currently supports only Python files" message
3. WHEN Call Hierarchy is selected on a non-Python file THEN the system SHALL display "Call hierarchy is only available for Python files" message
4. WHEN DB Schema is selected in a project without Python models THEN the system SHALL display "Database schema analysis requires Python models (Django/SQLAlchemy)" message
5. WHEN Git Analytics or JSON Utils are selected THEN the system SHALL work regardless of the current file type or project language

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a developer troubleshooting extension issues, I want clear diagnostic information when DoraCodeBirdView features are not working, so that I can identify and resolve problems quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension fails to activate THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information to the output channel
2. WHEN commands are not registered properly THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic messages
3. WHEN the sidebar fails to load THEN the system SHALL show helpful error messages with troubleshooting steps
4. WHEN context menus don't appear THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on potential causes
5. WHEN activation events fail THEN the system SHALL log the specific activation event that failed

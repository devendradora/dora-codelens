# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix large JSON performance issue in code graph initialization
  - Detect when JSON data exceeds 1MB and implement progressive loading
  - Add data size check in `prepareGraphData()` method to trigger optimization mode
  - Implement chunked processing for large datasets (process in batches of 1000 nodes)
  - Add progress indicator with percentage completion during graph initialization
  - Implement timeout protection and cancellation for long-running operations
  - Add fallback mode that shows simplified graph structure for very large datasets
  - Update webview HTML to show detailed loading progress instead of generic "Initializing" message
  - Add search for folder/files/function
  - Test with the 6.1MB `src/huge-graph.json` file to ensure graph loads successfully
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.5_

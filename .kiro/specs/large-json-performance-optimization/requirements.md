# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The DoraCodeLens extension currently experiences performance issues when rendering interactive code graphs with large JSON datasets. Users report that the code graph view gets stuck on "Initializing interactive code graph" when processing substantial amounts of data, making the feature unusable for larger codebases. This feature aims to optimize the performance of JSON processing and graph rendering to handle large datasets efficiently while maintaining the interactive visualization capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working with large codebases, I want the code graph view to load efficiently regardless of JSON size, so that I can visualize and navigate complex project structures without performance bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the code graph processes JSON data larger than 1MB THEN the system SHALL implement progressive loading mechanisms
2. WHEN initializing the interactive code graph THEN the system SHALL display loading progress indicators with percentage completion
3. WHEN JSON data exceeds memory thresholds THEN the system SHALL implement data chunking and virtualization
4. WHEN the graph contains more than 1000 nodes THEN the system SHALL implement level-of-detail rendering
5. IF JSON parsing takes longer than 5 seconds THEN the system SHALL provide user feedback and cancellation options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer analyzing large projects, I want responsive graph interactions even with substantial datasets, so that I can explore code relationships without lag or freezing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interacting with graph nodes THEN the system SHALL maintain frame rates above 30 FPS
2. WHEN zooming or panning large graphs THEN the system SHALL implement viewport culling for off-screen elements
3. WHEN searching within large graphs THEN the system SHALL return results within 2 seconds
4. WHEN filtering graph data THEN the system SHALL update the visualization within 1 second
5. IF graph rendering becomes unresponsive THEN the system SHALL provide recovery mechanisms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer with limited system resources, I want the extension to manage memory efficiently when processing large JSON files, so that it doesn't impact my overall development environment performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large JSON datasets THEN the system SHALL limit memory usage to under 500MB per analysis
2. WHEN memory usage approaches limits THEN the system SHALL implement garbage collection and cleanup routines
3. WHEN multiple analyses are running THEN the system SHALL queue and prioritize requests
4. WHEN system resources are low THEN the system SHALL provide degraded but functional visualization modes
5. IF memory leaks are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up resources

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with various project sizes, I want configurable performance settings, so that I can optimize the extension behavior for my specific use case and system capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the extension THEN the system SHALL provide performance preset options (fast, balanced, quality)
2. WHEN dealing with large datasets THEN the system SHALL allow users to set maximum node limits
3. WHEN rendering graphs THEN the system SHALL provide options to disable expensive visual effects
4. WHEN processing JSON THEN the system SHALL allow users to configure chunk sizes and batch processing
5. IF performance issues persist THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic tools and recommendations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer debugging performance issues, I want detailed feedback about processing status and bottlenecks, so that I can understand what's happening and make informed decisions about my analysis workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large JSON THEN the system SHALL display detailed progress information (parsing, processing, rendering stages)
2. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL log timing metrics and bottleneck identification
3. WHEN errors occur during processing THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages with suggested solutions
4. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL display performance summary statistics
5. IF processing fails THEN the system SHALL offer alternative analysis modes or data reduction options

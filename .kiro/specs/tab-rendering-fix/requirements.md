# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical bug in the VS Code extension where tabs in the TabbedWebviewProvider are not rendering properly despite the backend sending correct data and messages. The logs show that the webview is receiving data and tab switch commands, but the visual tab interface is not displaying correctly, leaving users unable to navigate between different analysis views.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want the tabbed interface to render properly so that I can see and interact with the tab buttons in the analysis dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TabbedWebviewProvider displays the analysis dashboard THEN the system SHALL render visible tab buttons in the tab header
2. WHEN tab buttons are rendered THEN the system SHALL display proper tab titles and icons
3. WHEN the webview receives updateData messages THEN the system SHALL ensure tab buttons are created and visible
4. WHEN tab rendering fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer analyzing code, I want to be able to click on tab buttons so that I can switch between different analysis views (Tech Stack, Code Graph, DB Schema, etc.).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a tab button THEN the system SHALL switch to the corresponding tab panel
2. WHEN a tab is active THEN the system SHALL apply the active styling to highlight the current tab
3. WHEN switching tabs THEN the system SHALL hide the previous tab panel and show the new one
4. WHEN tab switching occurs THEN the system SHALL update the currentTab state correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want the tab content to load properly so that I can view the analysis results in each tab.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tab is switched THEN the system SHALL call renderCurrentTabContent() successfully
2. WHEN tab content is rendered THEN the system SHALL display the appropriate content based on available analysis data
3. WHEN analysis data is missing for a tab THEN the system SHALL show a meaningful empty state message
4. WHEN content rendering fails THEN the system SHALL display an error state with retry options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer troubleshooting the extension, I want detailed logging and error handling so that I can identify why tabs are not rendering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the webview initializes THEN the system SHALL log the tab configuration and rendering process
2. WHEN JavaScript errors occur in the webview THEN the system SHALL capture and log them to the extension output
3. WHEN DOM elements are not found THEN the system SHALL log specific error messages about missing elements
4. WHEN tab rendering fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback emergency tab creation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want the tab interface to work consistently across different analysis types so that the user experience is reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying full code analysis THEN the system SHALL render all configured tabs (Tech Stack, Code Graph, DB Schema, Git Analytics)
2. WHEN displaying current file analysis THEN the system SHALL render only relevant tabs (Code Graph, Code Graph JSON)
3. WHEN switching between analysis types THEN the system SHALL update tab configurations appropriately
4. WHEN the webview becomes visible after being hidden THEN the system SHALL maintain proper tab state and rendering

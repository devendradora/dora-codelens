# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues in the VS Code extension where duplicate analysis calls are being triggered and the command manager is failing with null reference errors. The system currently shows multiple duplicate calls for full code analysis and other analysis operations, leading to performance issues and user experience problems. Additionally, there's a TypeError in the command manager when trying to read properties of null objects, indicating improper error handling and state management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want analysis operations to execute only once per trigger, so that I don't experience performance degradation and duplicate processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user triggers full code analysis THEN the system SHALL execute the analysis only once
2. WHEN multiple analysis requests are made in quick succession THEN the system SHALL debounce or queue them appropriately
3. WHEN an analysis is already running THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate executions
4. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL clear any pending duplicate requests

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want the command manager to handle null states gracefully, so that I don't encounter runtime errors during analysis operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the command manager receives null analysis results THEN it SHALL handle the null case without throwing errors
2. WHEN analysis data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallback behavior
3. WHEN reading properties from analysis results THEN the system SHALL validate object existence before property access
4. WHEN errors occur in command handling THEN the system SHALL log meaningful error messages and continue operation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want consistent state management across analysis operations, so that the UI reflects accurate analysis status and prevents conflicting operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an analysis starts THEN the system SHALL update the state to indicate analysis in progress
2. WHEN an analysis completes THEN the system SHALL update the state to reflect completion
3. WHEN multiple components request analysis status THEN they SHALL receive consistent state information
4. WHEN analysis fails THEN the system SHALL reset state appropriately and allow retry

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want proper coordination between analysis manager and command manager, so that analysis operations are executed efficiently without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analysis manager completes an analysis THEN it SHALL notify the command manager with valid result objects
2. WHEN the command manager receives analysis results THEN it SHALL validate the results before processing
3. WHEN analysis operations are triggered from multiple sources THEN the system SHALL coordinate to prevent conflicts
4. WHEN webview updates are needed THEN the system SHALL ensure data is available before attempting updates

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want comprehensive error logging and recovery mechanisms, so that I can diagnose issues and the system can recover from failures gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in analysis operations THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces
2. WHEN null reference errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the context and state that led to the error
3. WHEN analysis fails THEN the system SHALL provide recovery options or automatic retry mechanisms
4. WHEN duplicate calls are detected THEN the system SHALL log warnings to help with debugging

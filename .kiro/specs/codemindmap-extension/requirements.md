# Requirements Document

## Introduction

CodeMindMap is a VS Code extension that provides visual analysis and navigation capabilities for Python projects. The extension creates interactive graph visualizations of project structure, dependencies, and code complexity while supporting framework-specific patterns for Django, Flask, and FastAPI. It aims to help developers understand large codebases through visual representations and enhanced navigation features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Python Project Analysis

**User Story:** As a Python developer, I want the extension to automatically detect and analyze my project's tech stack and dependencies, so that I can understand the project structure without manual investigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Python project is opened THEN the system SHALL detect the tech stack from requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, or Pipfile
2. WHEN the analyzer runs THEN the system SHALL identify all external libraries and their versions
3. WHEN the project contains Django files THEN the system SHALL detect Django-specific patterns and configurations
4. WHEN the project contains Flask files THEN the system SHALL detect Flask routes via @app.route or Blueprint decorators
5. WHEN the project contains FastAPI files THEN the system SHALL detect FastAPI routes via @app.get/post decorators and Depends() dependencies
6. IF no Python project files are found THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message to the user

### Requirement 2: Module Graph Visualization

**User Story:** As a developer working with complex Python projects, I want to see a visual graph of project modules with complexity indicators, so that I can quickly identify areas that need attention and understand module relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analyzer completes THEN the system SHALL display a graph view with modules as rectangles
2. WHEN displaying modules THEN the system SHALL color-code each module based on complexity (green = low, orange = medium, red = high)
3. WHEN modules have dependencies THEN the system SHALL draw lines between modules that import or depend on each other
4. WHEN the user interacts with the graph THEN the system SHALL provide zoom, pan, and selection capabilities
5. WHEN a module is selected THEN the system SHALL highlight its direct dependencies and dependents
6. IF a module has no dependencies THEN the system SHALL display it as an isolated node

### Requirement 3: Function Call Hierarchy and Context Menu Organization

**User Story:** As a developer debugging or refactoring code, I want to right-click on any function and see organized CodeMindMap options including call hierarchy, so that I can understand how functions are interconnected throughout the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user right-clicks on code THEN the system SHALL display a "CodeMindMap" submenu in the context menu
2. WHEN the CodeMindMap submenu is opened THEN the system SHALL show options including "Graph View", "JSON View", and "Show Call Hierarchy"
3. WHEN "Show Call Hierarchy" is selected from the CodeMindMap submenu THEN the system SHALL display a full call graph showing all callers and callees
4. WHEN the call graph is displayed THEN the system SHALL show both incoming and outgoing function calls
5. WHEN a function in the call graph is clicked THEN the system SHALL navigate to that function's definition
6. WHEN the call hierarchy is complex THEN the system SHALL provide filtering and search capabilities
7. WHEN "Graph View" is selected THEN the system SHALL open the module graph visualization
8. WHEN "JSON View" is selected THEN the system SHALL display the raw analysis data in JSON format
9. IF a function has no callers or callees THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message

### Requirement 4: Framework-Specific Pattern Detection

**User Story:** As a web developer using Django, Flask, or FastAPI, I want the extension to understand framework-specific patterns and routing, so that I can navigate between URLs, views, and models efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing Django projects THEN the system SHALL map relationships between urls.py, views.py, and models/serializers
2. WHEN analyzing Flask projects THEN the system SHALL detect routes via @app.route decorators and Blueprint registrations
3. WHEN analyzing FastAPI projects THEN the system SHALL detect routes via @app.get/post decorators and dependency injection patterns
4. WHEN framework patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL provide specialized navigation between related components
5. WHEN multiple frameworks are detected THEN the system SHALL handle mixed framework patterns appropriately
6. IF no framework patterns are found THEN the system SHALL still provide basic module analysis

### Requirement 5: VS Code Integration

**User Story:** As a VS Code user, I want the extension to integrate seamlessly with my development workflow through sidebar panels, webviews, and editor enhancements, so that I can access analysis features without leaving my coding environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is activated THEN the system SHALL provide a dedicated CodeMindMap icon in the left sidebar navigation bar
2. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL display interactive graphs in a webview panel with properly loaded Cytoscape.js library
3. WHEN viewing code THEN the system SHALL display CodeLens annotations above functions showing complexity scores
4. WHEN the user requests analysis THEN the system SHALL run the Python analyzer script in the background
5. WHEN analysis is running THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators to the user
6. IF the Python analyzer fails THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages and troubleshooting guidance
7. WHEN the webview loads THEN the system SHALL ensure Cytoscape.js is properly defined and available for graph rendering

### Requirement 6: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a developer working with large Python projects, I want the extension to analyze my codebase efficiently without blocking my development workflow, so that I can use the tool on real-world projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing large projects THEN the system SHALL complete analysis within reasonable time limits (under 30 seconds for typical projects)
2. WHEN the analyzer runs THEN the system SHALL not block the VS Code interface
3. WHEN analysis results are cached THEN the system SHALL only re-analyze changed files on subsequent runs
4. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate cleanup and garbage collection
5. WHEN projects exceed size limits THEN the system SHALL provide options to analyze specific directories or modules
6. IF analysis takes too long THEN the system SHALL provide cancellation options to the user

### Requirement 7: Data Output and Extensibility

**User Story:** As a developer who might want to extend or integrate with the tool, I want the analyzer to output structured JSON data, so that I can build additional features or integrate with other tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analyzer completes THEN the system SHALL output structured JSON containing libraries, module graph, function call graph, and framework routes
2. WHEN JSON is generated THEN the system SHALL include all necessary metadata for visualization and navigation
3. WHEN the data format is defined THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility for future versions
4. WHEN errors occur during analysis THEN the system SHALL include error information in the JSON output
5. WHEN the extension is extended THEN the system SHALL provide clear APIs for accessing analysis data
6. IF the JSON structure changes THEN the system SHALL provide migration guidance for dependent tools

### Requirement 8: Sidebar Navigation and Icon Integration

**User Story:** As a VS Code user, I want CodeMindMap to have its own dedicated icon in the left sidebar navigation like other extensions, so that I can easily access the extension's features without cluttering the context menu.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN VS Code starts with the extension installed THEN the system SHALL display a CodeMindMap icon in the left sidebar navigation bar
2. WHEN the CodeMindMap sidebar icon is clicked THEN the system SHALL open the CodeMindMap panel showing project analysis and navigation options
3. WHEN the CodeMindMap panel is active THEN the system SHALL provide easy access to graph view, JSON view, and analysis controls
4. WHEN the sidebar panel is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the current project's module structure and dependencies
5. WHEN the user interacts with items in the sidebar THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate actions like opening files or showing graphs
6. IF no Python project is detected THEN the system SHALL display helpful guidance in the sidebar panel

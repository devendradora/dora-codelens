# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The debug panel in the full code analysis webview is showing incorrect tab information regardless of which tab is clicked. The debug output consistently shows "Tech Stack Tab Available: true" and tech stack content even when users click on Code Graph or Code Graph JSON tabs. This indicates a JavaScript tab switching logic issue where the debug information is not being updated to reflect the currently active tab.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want the debug panel to show accurate information about the currently active tab, so that I can properly debug tab-related issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking on the Tech Stack tab THEN the debug panel SHALL display "DEBUG: Tech Stack Tab" with tech stack specific information
2. WHEN clicking on the Code Graph tab THEN the debug panel SHALL display "DEBUG: Code Graph Tab" with code graph specific information  
3. WHEN clicking on the Code Graph JSON tab THEN the debug panel SHALL display "DEBUG: Code Graph JSON Tab" with JSON data specific information
4. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the debug panel SHALL update to show the correct tab type and content information
5. WHEN the debug panel shows tab information THEN it SHALL accurately reflect the currently visible tab content

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want the tab switching JavaScript to properly update all tab-related UI elements, so that the interface correctly reflects the active tab state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking a tab button THEN the system SHALL update the active tab button styling correctly
2. WHEN clicking a tab button THEN the system SHALL hide all inactive tab content panels
3. WHEN clicking a tab button THEN the system SHALL show only the selected tab content panel
4. WHEN switching tabs THEN the system SHALL update the debug information to match the active tab
5. WHEN tab switching occurs THEN all tab-related DOM elements SHALL be updated consistently

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want the tab content to remain distinct and not show duplicated content, so that each tab displays its intended information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Tech Stack tab THEN the system SHALL display only tech stack related content
2. WHEN viewing the Code Graph tab THEN the system SHALL display only code graph visualization content
3. WHEN viewing the Code Graph JSON tab THEN the system SHALL display only JSON data content
4. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the system SHALL ensure no content duplication occurs
5. WHEN tabs are rendered THEN each tab SHALL maintain its unique content and debug information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want proper error handling in the tab switching logic, so that tab switching failures don't break the entire interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tab switching encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log the error with detailed debugging information
2. WHEN a tab fails to load THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate error message in that tab
3. WHEN tab switching fails THEN the system SHALL maintain the previous tab state rather than breaking
4. WHEN debugging tab issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear information about tab states and content
5. WHEN tab switching errors occur THEN the system SHALL attempt to recover gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want the tab switching logic to properly manage tab state persistence, so that the selected tab is maintained across webview updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tab is selected THEN the system SHALL persist the tab state using vscode.setState
2. WHEN the webview is refreshed THEN the system SHALL restore the previously selected tab
3. WHEN tab state is restored THEN the system SHALL ensure the correct tab content is displayed
4. WHEN tab state persistence fails THEN the system SHALL default to the Tech Stack tab
5. WHEN managing tab state THEN the system SHALL ensure consistency between persisted state and UI state

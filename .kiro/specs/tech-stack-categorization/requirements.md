# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the full code analysis webview by organizing the tech stack analysis into specific categorized sections: Backend, Frontend, DevOps, and Others. This categorization will help developers quickly understand the different layers and components of their technology stack, making it easier to navigate and analyze project dependencies and frameworks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Backend Technology Categorization

**User Story:** As a developer analyzing my project's tech stack, I want to see backend-related technologies grouped together, so that I can quickly understand my server-side architecture and dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying the tech stack analysis THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated "Backend" section
2. WHEN categorizing technologies THEN the system SHALL include web frameworks in the backend section
3. WHEN categorizing technologies THEN the system SHALL include database-related libraries in the backend section
4. WHEN categorizing technologies THEN the system SHALL include API frameworks in the backend section
5. WHEN categorizing technologies THEN the system SHALL include server-side processing libraries in the backend section
6. WHEN categorizing backend technologies THEN the system SHALL include: Django, Flask, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Celery, Redis, PostgreSQL adapters, MongoDB drivers, authentication libraries, and similar server-side technologies

### Requirement 2: Frontend Technology Categorization

**User Story:** As a developer working on full-stack applications, I want to see frontend-related technologies grouped separately, so that I can understand my client-side technology choices and dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying the tech stack analysis THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated "Frontend" section
2. WHEN categorizing technologies THEN the system SHALL include JavaScript frameworks in the frontend section
3. WHEN categorizing technologies THEN the system SHALL include CSS frameworks and preprocessors in the frontend section
4. WHEN categorizing technologies THEN the system SHALL include frontend build tools in the frontend section
5. WHEN categorizing technologies THEN the system SHALL include UI component libraries in the frontend section
6. WHEN categorizing frontend technologies THEN the system SHALL include: React, Vue, Angular, jQuery, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, Webpack, Vite, Sass, Less, and similar client-side technologies

### Requirement 3: DevOps Technology Categorization

**User Story:** As a developer managing deployment and infrastructure, I want to see DevOps-related technologies grouped together, so that I can understand my deployment pipeline and infrastructure tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying the tech stack analysis THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated "DevOps" section
2. WHEN categorizing technologies THEN the system SHALL include containerization tools in the DevOps section
3. WHEN categorizing technologies THEN the system SHALL include CI/CD tools in the DevOps section
4. WHEN categorizing technologies THEN the system SHALL include cloud service libraries in the DevOps section
5. WHEN categorizing technologies THEN the system SHALL include monitoring and logging tools in the DevOps section
6. WHEN categorizing DevOps technologies THEN the system SHALL include: Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, AWS SDK, Azure SDK, Terraform, Ansible, Prometheus, Grafana, and similar infrastructure and deployment technologies

### Requirement 4: Others Technology Categorization

**User Story:** As a developer reviewing my complete tech stack, I want to see miscellaneous technologies that don't fit other categories grouped in an "Others" section, so that I have a complete view of all project dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying the tech stack analysis THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated "Others" section
2. WHEN categorizing technologies THEN the system SHALL include development tools in the Others section
3. WHEN categorizing technologies THEN the system SHALL include testing frameworks in the Others section
4. WHEN categorizing technologies THEN the system SHALL include utility libraries in the Others section
5. WHEN categorizing technologies THEN the system SHALL include any technology that doesn't fit Backend, Frontend, or DevOps categories in the Others section
6. WHEN categorizing Other technologies THEN the system SHALL include: pytest, unittest, requests, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, linting tools, formatting tools, and similar development utilities

### Requirement 5: Visual Section Organization

**User Story:** As a developer browsing the tech stack analysis, I want each category to be visually distinct and well-organized, so that I can quickly scan and find relevant technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying categorized sections THEN the system SHALL use distinct visual styling for each category
2. WHEN displaying categorized sections THEN the system SHALL use appropriate icons for each category (üîß Backend, üé® Frontend, ‚öôÔ∏è DevOps, üì¶ Others)
3. WHEN displaying categorized sections THEN the system SHALL show a count of technologies in each category
4. WHEN displaying categorized sections THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing grid layout within each category
5. WHEN displaying categorized sections THEN the system SHALL show categories in the order: Backend, Frontend, DevOps, Others
6. WHEN a category has no technologies THEN the system SHALL hide that category section

### Requirement 6: Technology Classification Logic

**User Story:** As a system processing various project types, I want to accurately classify technologies into appropriate categories, so that developers see a logical organization of their tech stack.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN classifying technologies THEN the system SHALL use predefined category mappings for known technologies
2. WHEN classifying technologies THEN the system SHALL use keyword-based classification for unknown technologies
3. WHEN classifying technologies THEN the system SHALL handle case-insensitive technology names
4. WHEN classifying technologies THEN the system SHALL prioritize exact matches over partial matches
5. WHEN a technology could fit multiple categories THEN the system SHALL use the most specific category
6. WHEN classification is uncertain THEN the system SHALL default to the "Others" category

### Requirement 7: Responsive Design for Categories

**User Story:** As a developer using different screen sizes, I want the categorized tech stack to be readable on all devices, so that I can review my project structure regardless of my setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the system SHALL display categories in a 2x2 grid layout (Backend/Frontend top row, DevOps/Others bottom row)
2. WHEN viewing on tablet THEN the system SHALL display categories in a single column with full width
3. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN the system SHALL display categories in a single column with optimized spacing
4. WHEN resizing the window THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition between layouts
5. WHEN displaying category content THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive grid behavior within each category section

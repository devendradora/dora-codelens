# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a comprehensive Django e-commerce example project to the DoraCodeLens examples directory. The project will demonstrate a complete e-commerce system with user management, product catalog, order processing, payment handling, and return management. It includes a database schema with proper relationships, REST APIs for all major operations, and a landing page with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer exploring DoraCodeLens capabilities, I want a comprehensive Django e-commerce example, so that I can understand how the extension analyzes complex Django projects with multiple models and relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the example project is analyzed THEN DoraCodeLens SHALL display the complete database schema with all table relationships
2. WHEN the project structure is visualized THEN the system SHALL show Django app organization with models, views, serializers, and URLs
3. WHEN framework detection runs THEN the system SHALL correctly identify Django framework patterns and dependencies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer learning Django, I want a realistic e-commerce database schema, so that I can understand complex model relationships and database design patterns.

2. WHEN foreign key relationships are defined THEN the system SHALL properly implement all specified relationships between tables
3. WHEN model fields are defined THEN the system SHALL include all specified field types, constraints, and default values
4. WHEN the database schema is analyzed THEN DoraCodeLens SHALL visualize the complete entity relationship diagram

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer building REST APIs, I want comprehensive API endpoints for the e-commerce system, so that I can understand Django REST framework patterns and best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN REST APIs are implemented THEN the system SHALL provide CRUD operations for all major entities (users, products, categories, orders, payments)
2. WHEN API endpoints are created THEN the system SHALL include proper serializers for data validation and transformation
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL implement user authentication and authorization
4. WHEN the API structure is analyzed THEN DoraCodeLens SHALL identify REST framework patterns and endpoint relationships

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working on frontend integration, I want a landing page with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that I can see how DoraCodeLens handles mixed technology stacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the landing page is created THEN the system SHALL include responsive HTML structure with product showcase
2. WHEN styling is applied THEN the system SHALL use modern CSS with grid/flexbox layouts and attractive design
3. WHEN interactivity is added THEN the system SHALL include JavaScript for dynamic content and API integration
4. WHEN the frontend code is analyzed THEN DoraCodeLens SHALL detect and categorize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer setting up the project, I want proper Django project structure and configuration, so that I can run the example locally and understand Django best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is structured THEN the system SHALL follow Django best practices with proper app organization
2. WHEN dependencies are defined THEN the system SHALL include requirements.txt with all necessary packages
3. WHEN configuration is set THEN the system SHALL include proper settings for development environment
4. WHEN migrations are created THEN the system SHALL include database migration files for all models

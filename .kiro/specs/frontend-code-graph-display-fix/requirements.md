# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Python analyzer (analyzer.py) successfully returns proper responses when analyzing code, but the frontend code graph and code graph JSON display are not showing the data correctly. This feature will fix the frontend display issues by removing legacy code and ensuring proper data flow from the Python analyzer to the frontend visualization components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the code graph visualization to display the analysis results from the Python analyzer, so that I can see the code structure and relationships in the frontend interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Python analyzer returns analysis data THEN the frontend SHALL display the code graph visualization correctly
2. WHEN analysis data is received THEN the code graph JSON SHALL be properly parsed and rendered
3. WHEN legacy code exists in the frontend THEN it SHALL be removed to prevent conflicts
4. WHEN the code graph is displayed THEN it SHALL show all nodes and relationships from the analyzer output

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend to handle analyzer responses without data loss, so that all analysis information is preserved and displayed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analyzer returns JSON data THEN the frontend SHALL parse it without data loss
2. WHEN data transformation occurs THEN it SHALL maintain the original structure and relationships
3. WHEN displaying the graph THEN all analyzer output fields SHALL be accessible in the visualization
4. IF data parsing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want legacy code removed from the frontend, so that there are no conflicts or outdated implementations affecting the display.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN legacy code is identified THEN it SHALL be completely removed from the codebase
2. WHEN removing legacy code THEN current functionality SHALL not be broken
3. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN only the current implementation SHALL remain active
4. WHEN legacy code is removed THEN the system SHALL use only the updated data flow patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the code graph display to be reliable and consistent, so that I can trust the visualization represents the actual code analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple analyses are run THEN the display SHALL consistently show correct results
2. WHEN switching between different analysis types THEN the display SHALL update appropriately
3. WHEN the analyzer output format is standard THEN the frontend SHALL handle it reliably
4. WHEN errors occur in display THEN they SHALL be logged and handled gracefully

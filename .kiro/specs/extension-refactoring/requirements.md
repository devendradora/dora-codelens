# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the need to refactor the large extension.ts file (2963 lines) into smaller, more maintainable modules while fixing any syntax errors. The current monolithic structure makes the code difficult to maintain, test, and understand. The refactoring will improve code organization, separation of concerns, and overall maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the extension, I want the extension.ts file split into logical modules so that I can easily locate and modify specific functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension.ts file is refactored THEN the system SHALL split it into separate modules based on functionality
2. WHEN modules are created THEN the system SHALL maintain clear separation of concerns
3. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL have no single file exceeding 500 lines
4. WHEN modules are imported THEN the system SHALL use proper TypeScript import/export statements
5. WHEN the extension loads THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working with the codebase, I want command management separated from the main extension class so that commands are easier to maintain and test.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN command registration is extracted THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated CommandManager class
2. WHEN commands are registered THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing command functionality
3. WHEN command handlers are organized THEN the system SHALL group related commands together
4. WHEN command registration fails THEN the system SHALL provide the same error handling as before
5. WHEN commands are executed THEN the system SHALL maintain the same behavior and error handling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer debugging the extension, I want analysis functionality separated into its own module so that analysis-related code is easier to understand and modify.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis functionality is extracted THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated AnalysisManager class
2. WHEN analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing analysis capabilities
3. WHEN analysis results are processed THEN the system SHALL maintain the same data flow and UI updates
4. WHEN analysis errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide the same error handling and user feedback
5. WHEN analysis state is managed THEN the system SHALL maintain proper state synchronization

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with UI components, I want webview and modal management separated so that UI-related code is organized and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI management is extracted THEN the system SHALL create dedicated UI management classes
2. WHEN webviews are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing webview functionality
3. WHEN modals are shown THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing modal behavior
4. WHEN UI state changes THEN the system SHALL maintain proper state management
5. WHEN UI errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide the same error handling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the extension, I want configuration and validation logic separated so that settings management is centralized and testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration management is extracted THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated ConfigurationManager class
2. WHEN configuration is validated THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing validation rules
3. WHEN settings are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide the same configuration interface
4. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL maintain the same change handling
5. WHEN configuration errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide the same error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer running the extension, I want all syntax errors fixed so that the extension compiles and runs without TypeScript errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the code is compiled THEN the system SHALL produce no TypeScript compilation errors
2. WHEN syntax errors are found THEN the system SHALL fix missing brackets, semicolons, and incomplete statements
3. WHEN imports are used THEN the system SHALL ensure all imports are properly declared and used
4. WHEN types are referenced THEN the system SHALL ensure all types are properly defined or imported
5. WHEN the extension runs THEN the system SHALL execute without runtime errors caused by syntax issues

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer testing the extension, I want the refactored modules to be easily testable so that unit tests can be written for individual components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules are created THEN the system SHALL design them with testability in mind
2. WHEN dependencies are used THEN the system SHALL allow for dependency injection or mocking
3. WHEN classes are designed THEN the system SHALL follow single responsibility principle
4. WHEN methods are created THEN the system SHALL keep them focused and testable
5. WHEN interfaces are defined THEN the system SHALL provide clear contracts for testing

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want all existing functionality preserved so that no features are lost during the refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing commands and their behavior
2. WHEN the extension is activated THEN the system SHALL initialize all components properly
3. WHEN analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL produce the same results as before
4. WHEN UI components are displayed THEN the system SHALL show the same interfaces and functionality
5. WHEN the extension is deactivated THEN the system SHALL clean up resources properly

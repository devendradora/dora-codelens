# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Implement comprehensive tech stack analysis improvements

  - Create `calculateTechStackStats()` method to compute project statistics from code_graph_json
  - Implement `countNodesRecursively()` to traverse and count files, folders, classes, functions
  - Add `detectPackageManager()` method with priority-based detection (Poetry > Pipenv > pip > Yarn > npm)
  - Create `findFileInProject()` utility to search for package manager files in project structure
  - Fix statistics display to show accurate counts instead of 0 values
  - Add total folders, total classes, total functions, and package manager to statistics panel
  - Implement `filterMajorFrameworks()` to show only major Python frameworks (Django, Flask, FastAPI, etc.)
  - Rename "Frameworks & Platforms" section to "Frameworks" and exclude libraries like Celery, NumPy
  - Create `processAndSortLibraries()` to handle multiple data formats and sort alphabetically
  - Implement responsive CSS Grid layout for libraries (4 columns desktop, 3 tablet, 2 mobile, 1 small mobile)
  - Add `.tech-libraries-grid` and `.tech-library-item` CSS classes with hover effects
  - Update HTML generation to use new helper methods and grid layout structure
  - Add comprehensive error handling and validation for all data processing
  - Compile and test the complete solution with real project data
  - _Requirements: 1.1-1.7, 2.1-2.4, 3.1-3.5, 4.1-4.5, 5.1-5.5, 6.1-6.5_

- [x] 2. Debug and fix remaining tech stack display issues
  - Investigate why languages count shows 0 despite Python files being present in the project
  - Debug framework detection to ensure Django and other frameworks are properly detected and displayed
  - Fix card layout to ensure statistics cards display on the same line horizontally
  - Remove "TOTAL" prefix from card labels (change "Total Files" to "Files", "Total Folders" to "Folders", etc.)
  - Add debugging logs to trace data flow from analysis to display
  - Test with real project data to verify all statistics display correctly
  - Ensure responsive layout works properly across different screen sizes
  - Validate that the statistics panel shows: Files, Folders, Classes, Functions, Languages, Package Manager
  - _Requirements: 1.1-1.7, 2.1-2.4_

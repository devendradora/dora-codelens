# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the VS Code extension with JSON utilities accessible through context menus and improves debugging capabilities. It addresses the need for quick JSON manipulation tools and better visibility into backend data structures during development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access JSON formatting utilities through the context menu, so that I can quickly format, minify, or view JSON data without switching tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I right-click on a JSON file THEN the system SHALL display a "JSON Utilities" submenu in the context menu
2. WHEN I select "Format" from the JSON Utilities submenu THEN the system SHALL format the JSON content in the same file with proper indentation
3. WHEN I select "Minify" from the JSON Utilities submenu THEN the system SHALL compress the JSON content in the same file to a single line
4. WHEN I select "Tree Viewer" from the JSON Utilities submenu THEN the system SHALL open a tree view of the JSON structure in a new panel
5. IF the file contains invalid JSON THEN the system SHALL display an error message and not modify the file

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database schema graph to be visible in the analysis views, so that I can understand the database structure of my project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run database schema analysis THEN the system SHALL display the schema graph visually in the webview
2. WHEN the database schema graph loads THEN the system SHALL ensure all nodes and connections are properly rendered
3. IF the graph fails to render THEN the system SHALL display a fallback message with troubleshooting information
4. WHEN I interact with the graph THEN the system SHALL provide zoom, pan, and node selection capabilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a debug tab that shows backend JSON data for all analysis views, so that I can troubleshoot data issues and understand the raw data structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developer debug mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL add a "Backend JSON" tab to all analysis webviews
2. WHEN I click on the "Backend JSON" tab THEN the system SHALL display the raw JSON data being processed by the backend
3. WHEN the backend data updates THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the JSON display in the debug tab
4. WHEN I view the backend JSON THEN the system SHALL format it with proper syntax highlighting and collapsible sections
5. IF no backend data is available THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating "No data available"

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues with the current tech stack categorization system in DoraCodeLens. Users are experiencing duplicate technologies, missing categories (DevOps and Frontend), and poor layout organization. The enhancement will implement deduplication logic, ensure all categories are visible, and redesign the layout with full-width category sections containing organized subcategories.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Duplicate Technology Detection

**User Story:** As a developer analyzing my project, I want to see each technology listed only once in the appropriate category, so that I can get an accurate view of my tech stack without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN technologies are categorized THEN the system SHALL remove duplicate entries within each category
2. WHEN a technology appears in multiple sources THEN the system SHALL consolidate it into a single entry
3. WHEN Django appears multiple times THEN the system SHALL show it only once in the Backend category
4. WHEN deduplicating technologies THEN the system SHALL preserve version information when available
5. WHEN deduplicating technologies THEN the system SHALL maintain the most complete information available

### Requirement 2: Ensure All Categories Are Always Visible

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see all five main categories (Backend, Frontend, Databases, DevOps, Others) even when they're empty, so that I understand the complete categorization structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tech stack analysis loads THEN the system SHALL display all 5 categories: Backend, Frontend, Databases, DevOps, Others
2. WHEN a category has no technologies THEN the system SHALL still display the category with an empty state message
3. WHEN DevOps technologies are not detected THEN the system SHALL still show the DevOps category section
4. WHEN Frontend technologies are not detected THEN the system SHALL still show the Frontend category section
5. WHEN displaying empty categories THEN the system SHALL show "No technologies detected in this category"

### Requirement 3: Implement Full-Width Category Layout

**User Story:** As a developer browsing my tech stack, I want each main category to occupy the full width with clear subcategories, so that I can easily navigate and understand the organization of my technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying categories THEN each main category SHALL occupy the full width of the container
2. WHEN displaying a category THEN the system SHALL show a prominent category header with icon and name
3. WHEN a category has technologies THEN the system SHALL organize them into subcategories: Languages, Package Managers, Frameworks, Libraries
4. WHEN displaying subcategories THEN each SHALL have a clear subheading and organized list
5. WHEN a subcategory is empty THEN the system SHALL hide that subcategory section

### Requirement 4: Organize Technologies by Type Within Categories

**User Story:** As a developer, I want technologies within each category organized by type (Languages, Package Managers, Frameworks, Libraries), so that I can quickly find specific types of technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN categorizing Backend technologies THEN the system SHALL separate Python (Language), pip/Poetry (Package Managers), Django/Flask (Frameworks), and other libraries
2. WHEN categorizing Frontend technologies THEN the system SHALL separate JavaScript/TypeScript (Languages), npm/Yarn (Package Managers), React/Vue (Frameworks), and UI libraries
3. WHEN categorizing DevOps technologies THEN the system SHALL separate Docker (Containerization), Kubernetes (Orchestration), CI/CD tools, and monitoring tools
4. WHEN categorizing Database technologies THEN the system SHALL separate by database type: SQL, NoSQL, In-Memory, etc.
5. WHEN a technology type cannot be determined THEN the system SHALL place it in the "Others" subcategory within the main category

### Requirement 5: Implement Smart Technology Classification

**User Story:** As a system processing various technologies, I want to intelligently classify each technology by both main category and subcategory type, so that users see a well-organized tech stack overview.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing Python THEN the system SHALL classify it as Backend > Languages
2. WHEN processing Django THEN the system SHALL classify it as Backend > Frameworks
3. WHEN processing pip/Poetry THEN the system SHALL classify it as Backend > Package Managers
4. WHEN processing React THEN the system SHALL classify it as Frontend > Frameworks
5. WHEN processing Docker THEN the system SHALL classify it as DevOps > Containerization
6. WHEN processing PostgreSQL THEN the system SHALL classify it as Databases > SQL Databases
7. WHEN processing unknown technologies THEN the system SHALL classify them as Others > Miscellaneous

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Visual Design and Layout

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and professional layout for the tech stack analysis, so that I can easily scan and understand my project's technology composition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying categories THEN each SHALL have a distinct visual section with proper spacing
2. WHEN displaying category headers THEN they SHALL be prominent with appropriate typography and icons
3. WHEN displaying subcategories THEN they SHALL have clear visual hierarchy with consistent styling
4. WHEN displaying technology lists THEN they SHALL use appropriate spacing and visual indicators
5. WHEN viewing on different screen sizes THEN the layout SHALL remain readable and well-organized
6. WHEN a category is empty THEN it SHALL have a subtle but clear empty state design

### Requirement 7: Maintain Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a system processing large tech stacks, I want the categorization to be fast and reliable, so that users get quick results without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large numbers of technologies THEN the system SHALL complete categorization within 2 seconds
2. WHEN encountering malformed data THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without breaking the display
3. WHEN deduplicating technologies THEN the system SHALL use efficient algorithms to avoid performance issues
4. WHEN classifying technologies THEN the system SHALL use optimized lookup mechanisms
5. WHEN rendering the layout THEN the system SHALL minimize DOM operations for better performance

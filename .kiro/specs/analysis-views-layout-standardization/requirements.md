# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature standardizes the layout and styling of database schema analysis, git analytics, and current file analysis webviews to match the modern tabbed navigation system used in the full code analysis webview. Currently, these three analysis views use inconsistent layouts and styling, creating a fragmented user experience. The goal is to create a unified, consistent interface across all analysis views.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want all analysis views to have consistent navigation and layout, so that I can easily switch between different types of analysis without learning different interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open database schema analysis THEN the webview SHALL display a tabbed navigation bar similar to full code analysis
2. WHEN I open git analytics THEN the webview SHALL display a tabbed navigation bar similar to full code analysis  
3. WHEN I open current file analysis THEN the webview SHALL display a tabbed navigation bar similar to full code analysis
4. WHEN I navigate between tabs in any analysis view THEN the active tab SHALL be visually highlighted
5. WHEN I view any analysis webview THEN the content SHALL be displayed in scrollable sections below the navigation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database schema analysis to have organized tabs for different aspects of the schema, so that I can easily navigate between schema overview, visualization, and table details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open database schema analysis THEN the navigation SHALL display tabs for "Schema Overview", "Schema Graph", and "Table Details"
2. WHEN I click the "Schema Overview" tab THEN it SHALL show database metadata and statistics
3. WHEN I click the "Schema Graph" tab THEN it SHALL show the interactive schema visualization
4. WHEN I click the "Table Details" tab THEN it SHALL show the detailed table list and information
5. WHEN I switch between tabs THEN the content SHALL update without page reload

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the git analytics to have organized tabs for different types of analytics data, so that I can easily explore repository insights, contributor data, and timeline information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open git analytics THEN the navigation SHALL display tabs for "Repository Overview", "Contributors", and "Timeline Charts"
2. WHEN I click the "Repository Overview" tab THEN it SHALL show repository statistics and summary information
3. WHEN I click the "Contributors" tab THEN it SHALL show author contributions and detailed contributor metrics
4. WHEN I click the "Timeline Charts" tab THEN it SHALL show commit timeline visualizations and activity charts
5. WHEN I switch between tabs THEN the charts SHALL render properly in their respective sections

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the current file analysis to have organized tabs for different aspects of file analysis, so that I can easily navigate between complexity metrics, dependencies, and visualizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open current file analysis THEN the navigation SHALL display tabs for "File Overview", "Complexity Analysis", and "Dependencies"
2. WHEN I click the "File Overview" tab THEN it SHALL show file information and basic metrics
3. WHEN I click the "Complexity Analysis" tab THEN it SHALL show complexity metrics and function analysis
4. WHEN I click the "Dependencies" tab THEN it SHALL show dependency analysis and framework patterns
5. WHEN I switch between tabs THEN the content SHALL be properly organized and readable

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all analysis views to use consistent styling and visual elements, so that the extension feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view any analysis webview THEN the navigation bar SHALL use the same styling as full code analysis
2. WHEN I view any analysis webview THEN the tab buttons SHALL have consistent hover and active states
3. WHEN I view any analysis webview THEN the content sections SHALL use consistent padding, margins, and typography
4. WHEN I view any analysis webview THEN the color scheme SHALL match the VS Code theme consistently
5. WHEN I view any analysis webview THEN the icons and visual elements SHALL be consistent across all views

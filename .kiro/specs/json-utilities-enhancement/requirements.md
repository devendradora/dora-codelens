# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the JSON utilities functionality by removing the tree view option, adding minify capability, and implementing smart context-aware enabling/disabling of JSON commands based on file type and cursor position.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want JSON utility commands to be contextually enabled/disabled so that I only see relevant options when working with JSON content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the active file is not a JSON file THEN the system SHALL disable all JSON utility commands in the context menu
2. WHEN the cursor is not positioned on valid JSON content THEN the system SHALL disable JSON utility commands
3. WHEN the active file is a JSON file AND contains valid JSON THEN the system SHALL enable JSON utility commands
4. WHEN the cursor is positioned on a JSON string or object in any file type THEN the system SHALL enable JSON utility commands

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to minify JSON content to reduce file size and remove unnecessary whitespace.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select "Minify JSON" from the context menu THEN the system SHALL compress the JSON by removing all unnecessary whitespace
2. WHEN minifying JSON THEN the system SHALL preserve the JSON structure and validity
3. WHEN minifying invalid JSON THEN the system SHALL show an error message and not modify the content
4. WHEN minifying JSON THEN the system SHALL replace the selected text or entire file content with the minified version

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I no longer want the JSON tree view functionality as it's not needed for my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing JSON utilities THEN the system SHALL NOT display a tree view option
2. WHEN the extension loads THEN the system SHALL NOT register any tree view related commands
3. WHEN using JSON utilities THEN the system SHALL only provide format, validate, and minify options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent JSON utility commands available across all file types with appropriate enabling/disabling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN right-clicking in any file THEN the system SHALL show JSON utility commands in the context menu
2. WHEN the context is not JSON-related THEN the system SHALL show the commands in a disabled state
3. WHEN the context is JSON-related THEN the system SHALL show the commands in an enabled state
4. WHEN hovering over disabled commands THEN the system SHALL show a tooltip explaining why the command is disabled

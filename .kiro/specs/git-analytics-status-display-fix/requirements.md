# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The git analytics view in DoraCodeLens is not displaying all status information correctly. Users are experiencing incomplete or missing data in the git analytics webview, which affects their ability to get comprehensive insights about their repository's commit history, contributor statistics, and timeline data. This feature aims to fix the data mapping and display issues to ensure all git analytics status information is properly shown to users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using DoraCodeLens, I want to see complete repository status information in the git analytics view, so that I can get accurate insights about my project's git history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the git analytics view is opened THEN the system SHALL display complete repository information including name, branch, total commits, contributors count, and active period
2. WHEN repository data is available THEN the system SHALL show all repository statistics without missing fields
3. IF repository information is incomplete THEN the system SHALL display appropriate fallback values or error messages
4. WHEN the view loads THEN the system SHALL validate that all expected repository fields are present and properly formatted

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer analyzing team contributions, I want to see complete author contribution statistics, so that I can understand each contributor's impact on the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN author contributions are displayed THEN the system SHALL show all available metrics including commits, lines added/removed, files changed, and contribution percentage
2. WHEN author data is processed THEN the system SHALL ensure all calculated fields (like contribution percentage) are properly computed and displayed
3. IF author statistics are missing THEN the system SHALL display appropriate empty state messages
4. WHEN multiple authors exist THEN the system SHALL sort and display them correctly with complete information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer tracking project timeline, I want to see complete commit timeline data, so that I can understand the project's development patterns over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN commit timeline is displayed THEN the system SHALL show all timeline entries with dates, commit counts, and author information
2. WHEN timeline data is processed THEN the system SHALL ensure proper date formatting and chronological ordering
3. IF timeline data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL handle missing dates gracefully
4. WHEN charts are rendered THEN the system SHALL use complete timeline data for accurate visualizations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using the git analytics feature, I want to see proper error handling and status messages, so that I understand when data is incomplete or unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is missing or incomplete THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages or empty state indicators
2. WHEN analysis fails THEN the system SHALL show specific error information to help with troubleshooting
3. IF partial data is available THEN the system SHALL display what's available and indicate what's missing
4. WHEN loading data THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states and progress indicators

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the git analytics data mapping to be robust and consistent, so that all information from the Python analyzer is properly displayed in the TypeScript webview.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Python analyzer returns data THEN the TypeScript handler SHALL properly map all fields to the webview
2. WHEN data structures differ between Python and TypeScript THEN the system SHALL handle type conversions correctly
3. IF field names or structures change THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility or provide clear migration paths
4. WHEN debugging data issues THEN the system SHALL provide adequate logging for troubleshooting data mapping problems

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The DoraCodeBirdView extension is experiencing runtime errors in the full code analysis webview due to data structure mismatches between the frontend expectations and the latest updated backend response format. The webview expects `analysisData.modules` to be an array but the updated Python analyzer now returns a different data structure, causing "forEach is not a function" errors. This feature will implement robust data validation and transformation to ensure the frontend properly handles the latest backend response format.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want the full code analysis webview to properly handle the latest updated backend response format, so that I can see analysis results without runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the webview receives the latest backend response THEN the system SHALL adapt to the new data structure format
2. WHEN the backend response structure has changed THEN the system SHALL detect and handle the new format appropriately
3. WHEN processing the updated response format THEN the system SHALL extract modules data correctly regardless of structure
4. WHEN the new backend format is incompatible with current processing THEN the system SHALL transform it to a compatible format
5. IF the backend response format cannot be processed THEN the system SHALL log the actual structure and display a helpful error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want all webviews to automatically adapt to backend response format updates, so that the frontend stays synchronized with backend changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend updates its response format THEN all webviews SHALL automatically handle the new structure
2. WHEN processing updated backend responses THEN the system SHALL use a common adaptation layer
3. WHEN backend format changes are detected THEN the system SHALL log the changes for tracking
4. WHEN multiple webviews need the same backend data THEN they SHALL use consistent data transformation logic
5. IF the backend provides version information THEN the system SHALL use it to select appropriate processing logic

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want detailed logging when data structure issues occur, so that I can quickly identify and resolve the root cause.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data validation fails THEN the system SHALL log the expected vs actual data structure
2. WHEN forEach errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the type and sample content of the problematic data
3. WHEN webview rendering fails THEN the system SHALL identify which specific data field caused the issue
4. WHEN data transformation is applied THEN the system SHALL log what transformations were performed
5. IF debugging mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL output verbose data processing information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want the webviews to gracefully degrade when data is incomplete, so that I can still see partial analysis results rather than complete failure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules data is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL display an empty state with helpful messaging
2. WHEN some module data is valid but other parts are malformed THEN the system SHALL render the valid portions
3. WHEN critical data fields are missing THEN the system SHALL show placeholder content with retry options
4. WHEN data recovery is possible THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic correction and notify the user
5. IF no data can be processed THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for resolving the issue

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want the frontend to automatically detect and use the latest backend response format, so that I always get the most current analysis data without manual updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend response format is updated THEN the frontend SHALL automatically detect the new structure
2. WHEN processing the latest backend response THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most recent data format
3. WHEN multiple response formats are possible THEN the system SHALL identify and use the correct one
4. WHEN the latest backend response includes new fields THEN the frontend SHALL utilize them if beneficial
5. IF the backend response format is backwards incompatible THEN the system SHALL provide clear migration guidance

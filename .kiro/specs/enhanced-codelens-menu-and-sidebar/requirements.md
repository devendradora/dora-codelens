# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the DoraCodeLens extension with improved context menu structure, inline code lens functionality, sidebar icon updates, and sidebar content improvements. The enhancement focuses on creating a hierarchical menu structure for code lens controls, ensuring proper inline analysis display, updating the sidebar icon, and populating the sidebar with useful project information.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a dynamic context menu for code lens controls, so that I can easily toggle code lens functionality with clear status indication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN right-clicking in a Python file AND code lens is disabled THEN the context menu SHALL show "Enable Code Lens Inline" as a direct menu item
2. WHEN right-clicking in a Python file AND code lens is enabled THEN the context menu SHALL show "Disable Code Lens Inline" as a direct menu item
3. WHEN clicking "Enable Code Lens Inline" THEN the system SHALL enable inline code lens functionality and update the menu text
4. WHEN clicking "Disable Code Lens Inline" THEN the system SHALL disable inline code lens functionality and update the menu text
5. WHEN code lens state changes THEN the context menu SHALL immediately reflect the new state without requiring restart

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want inline code lens to show current file analysis results, so that I can see complexity and metrics directly in my code without opening separate views.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code lens is enabled THEN the system SHALL NOT show "analyze full project" code lens at the top of files
2. WHEN code lens is enabled THEN the system SHALL display inline complexity information above functions and classes
3. WHEN analysis is running THEN the system SHALL show "Analyzing class" and "Analyzing complexity" indicators
4. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL display JSON response results from current file analysis with color-coded complexity indicators
5. WHEN complexity is low (â‰¤5) THEN the system SHALL display green indicator (ðŸŸ¢) with complexity metrics
6. WHEN complexity is medium (6-10) THEN the system SHALL display yellow indicator (ðŸŸ¡) with complexity metrics
7. WHEN complexity is high (>10) THEN the system SHALL display red indicator (ðŸ”´) with complexity metrics
8. WHEN cached analysis exists THEN the system SHALL use cached results immediately
9. WHEN no cache exists THEN the system SHALL perform new analysis and cache the results
10. WHEN analysis fails THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error indicators in code lens

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the sidebar to use the updated icon, so that the extension branding is consistent throughout the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension loads THEN the sidebar icon SHALL use "resources/dora-code-lens-kiro.png"
2. WHEN viewing the activity bar THEN the DoraCodeLens icon SHALL display the updated branding image
3. WHEN the sidebar is active THEN the icon SHALL be clearly visible and properly sized
4. WHEN switching between light and dark themes THEN the icon SHALL remain visible and appropriate

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the sidebar populated with useful project information, so that I can quickly access relevant analysis data and actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening the sidebar THEN it SHALL display a "Quick Actions" section with commonly used commands
2. WHEN code lens is disabled THEN the sidebar SHALL show "Enable Code Lens Inline" in quick actions
3. WHEN code lens is enabled THEN the sidebar SHALL show "Disable Code Lens Inline" in quick actions
4. WHEN the sidebar loads THEN it SHALL show "Recent Analysis" section with timestamps of last analyses
5. WHEN project analysis data exists THEN the sidebar SHALL display "Project Overview" with key metrics
6. WHEN the sidebar is populated THEN it SHALL include "Analysis Status" showing current operation progress
7. WHEN clicking sidebar items THEN they SHALL trigger appropriate actions or navigation
8. WHEN no analysis data exists THEN the sidebar SHALL show helpful getting started information
9. WHEN code lens state changes THEN the sidebar SHALL immediately refresh to show updated quick actions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want code lens to reliably show complexity information when enabled, so that I can see function and class metrics directly in my code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code lens is enabled AND a Python file is open THEN complexity indicators SHALL appear above all functions and classes
2. WHEN enabling code lens THEN the system SHALL immediately trigger analysis and display results
3. WHEN opening a Python file with code lens enabled THEN complexity information SHALL be visible within 2 seconds
4. WHEN analysis completes THEN the code lens SHALL show actual complexity numbers with color indicators
5. WHEN no analysis data is available THEN the code lens SHALL show "Analyzing..." placeholders that trigger analysis when clicked
6. WHEN analysis fails THEN the code lens SHALL show error indicators with retry options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and user feedback, so that I understand what's happening when operations fail or are in progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is in progress THEN the system SHALL show clear progress indicators
2. WHEN analysis fails THEN the system SHALL display meaningful error messages
3. WHEN cache operations fail THEN the system SHALL fallback to new analysis gracefully
4. WHEN Python path is not configured THEN the system SHALL guide users to setup
5. WHEN network or file system errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages

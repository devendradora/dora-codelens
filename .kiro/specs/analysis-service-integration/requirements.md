# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical missing functionality in the DoraCodeBirdView extension where several analysis services are not properly integrated or implemented. The logs show that the current file analysis command fails due to missing methods, and certain tabs (Git Analytics, DB Schema) are not functioning properly. This affects the core functionality of the extension and prevents users from accessing key analysis features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want the current file analysis command to work so that I can analyze the currently open file.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user triggers the current file analysis command THEN the system SHALL execute the analysis without throwing "function not found" errors
2. WHEN the current file analysis runs THEN the system SHALL call the appropriate analyzer methods for the current file
3. WHEN current file analysis completes THEN the system SHALL display the results in the appropriate webview
4. WHEN current file analysis fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer analyzing my codebase, I want the Git Analytics tab to work properly so that I can view git-related insights about my code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Git Analytics tab is selected THEN the system SHALL load and display git analytics data
2. WHEN git analytics data is available THEN the system SHALL render charts and visualizations properly
3. WHEN git analytics fails to load THEN the system SHALL show an appropriate error message with retry options
4. WHEN no git data is available THEN the system SHALL display a meaningful empty state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with databases, I want the DB Schema tab to function correctly so that I can visualize database relationships and schema information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the DB Schema tab is selected THEN the system SHALL analyze and display database schema information
2. WHEN database schema is detected THEN the system SHALL render schema diagrams and relationships
3. WHEN no database schema is found THEN the system SHALL display an informative message about schema detection
4. WHEN schema analysis fails THEN the system SHALL provide error details and retry functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want all analysis services to be properly integrated so that the extension works reliably without method missing errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension initializes THEN the system SHALL ensure all required analysis methods are available
2. WHEN analysis managers are created THEN the system SHALL properly wire up all service dependencies
3. WHEN commands are registered THEN the system SHALL verify that all command handlers have their required dependencies
4. WHEN service integration fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer troubleshooting analysis issues, I want comprehensive error handling and logging so that I can understand what's going wrong with the analysis services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis services encounter errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces
2. WHEN methods are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which service needs implementation
3. WHEN analysis fails THEN the system SHALL attempt graceful degradation rather than complete failure
4. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging of all analysis service interactions
